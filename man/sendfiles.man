.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.BR sendfiles ,
is used to send a collection
of files and directories via electronic mail.
.PP
.RS 5
sendfiles recipient \*(lqsubject\*(rq files\0...
.RE
.PP
.B sendfiles
will archive the files and directories you name
with the
.B tar
command, and then mail the compressed
archive to the \*(lqrecipient\*(rq with the given \*(lqsubject\*(rq.
The archive
will be automatically split up into as many messages as necessary
in order to get past most mailers.
.PP
The
.B \-from
switch can, and should, be used to specify the sender's mailbox (name
and email address).  Alternatively, the
.B PERSON
environment variable can be used for the same purpose.
If neither is used,
.B sendfiles
will supply a \*(lqFrom:\*(rq header field using the sender's local
mailbox, see
.I localmbox
in
.IR mh-format (5).
.PP
The remaining command line switches select the compression program.
One of these can be used to override the run-time determination of
the compression program by
.BR sendfiles .
.PP
Sometimes you want
.B sendfiles
to pause after posting a partial
message.  This is usually the case when you are running
.B sendmail
and expect to generate a lot of partial messages.  If the first
argument given to
.B sendfiles
starts with a dash, then it is
interpreted as the number of seconds to pause in between postings,
e.g.,
.PP
.RS 5
sendfiles -30 recipient \*(lqsubject\*(rq files\0...
.RE
.PP
will pause 30 seconds in between each posting.
.PP
.SS "Extracting the Received Files"
When these messages are received, invoke
.B mhstore
once for
the list of messages.  The default is for
.B mhstore
to store
the combined parts as a new message in the current folder, although
this can be changed using storage formatting strings.  You can then
use
.B mhlist
to find out what's inside; possibly followed by
.B mhstore
again to write the archive to a file where you can
subsequently uncompress and untar it.  For instance:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
% mhlist 5-8
 msg part  type/subtype             size description
   5       message/partial           47K part 1 of 4
   6       message/partial           47K part 2 of 4
   7       message/partial           47K part 3 of 4
   8       message/partial           18K part 4 of 4
% mhstore 5-8
reassembling partials 5,6,7,8 to folder inbox as message 9
% mhlist -verbose 9
 msg part  type/subtype             size description
   9       application/octet-stream 118K
             (extract with uncompress | tar xvpf -)
             type=tar
             conversions=compress
% mhstore 9
% uncompress < 9.tar.Z | tar xvpf -
.fi
.RE
.PP
Alternately, by using the
.B \-auto
switch,
.B mhstore
will automatically do the extraction for you:
.PP
.RS 5
.nf
% mhlist 5-8
 msg part  type/subtype             size description
   5       message/partial           47K part 1 of 4
   6       message/partial           47K part 2 of 4
   7       message/partial           47K part 3 of 4
   8       message/partial           18K part 4 of 4
% mhstore 5-8
reassembling partials 5,6,7,8 to folder inbox as message 9
% mhlist -verbose 9
 msg part  type/subtype             size description
   9       application/octet-stream 118K
             (extract with uncompress | tar xvpf -)
             type=tar
             conversions=compress
% mhstore -auto 9
-- tar listing appears here as files are extracted
.fi
.RE
.PP
As the second
.B tar
listing is generated, the files are extracted.
A prudent user will never put
.B \-auto
in the
.I \&.mh\(ruprofile
file.  The correct procedure is to first use
.B mhlist
to find out what will be extracted.  Then
.B mhstore
can be invoked with
.B \-auto
to perform the extraction.
