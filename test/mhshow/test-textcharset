1.  The Earthquake


The train from 'Frisco was very late.  It should have arrived at
Hugson's Siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the
gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled
up to the open shed that served for the station-house.  As it came to a
stop the conductor called out in a loud voice:

=93Hugson's Siding!=94

At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the
car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage
covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked
under her arm.  The conductor helped her off the car and then the
engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and
moved slowly away up the track.  The reason he was so late was because
all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and
trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the
rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers.  So
he moved the cars slowly and with caution.

The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared
around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.

The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and
did not look very inviting.  As she peered through the soft gray light
not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any
person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and
buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away.  She walked
toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless,
with its head hanging down almost to the ground.  It was a big horse,
tall and bony, with long legs and large knees and feet.  She could
count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of his body,
and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it
did not fit.  His tail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been
broken in many places and fastened together again with cords and bits
of wire.  The buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side
curtains.  Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the
girl saw a boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.

She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol.
Presently he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes
briskly.

=93Hello!=94 he said, seeing her, =93are you Dorothy Gale?=94

=93Yes,=94 she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking
gray eyes.  =93Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?=94

=93Of course,=94 he answered.  =93Train in?=94

=93I couldn't be here if it wasn't,=94 she said.

He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank.  Jumping out of
the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage
on the floor in front.

=93Canary-birds?=94 he asked.

=93Oh no; it's just Eureka, my kitten.  I thought that was the best way
to carry her.=94

The boy nodded.

=93Eureka's a funny name for a cat,=94 he remarked.

=93I named my kitten that because I found it,=94 she explained.  =93Uncle
Henry says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'=94

=93All right; hop in.=94

She climbed into the buggy and he followed her.  Then the boy picked up
the reins, shook them, and said =93Gid-dap!=94

The horse did not stir.  Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his
drooping ears, but that was all.

=93Gid-dap!=94 called the boy, again.

The horse stood still.

=93Perhaps,=94 said Dorothy, =93if you untied him, he would go.=94

The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.

=93Guess I'm half asleep yet,=94 he said, untying the horse.  =93But Jim
knows his business all right--don't you, Jim?=94 patting the long nose of
the animal.

Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at
once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot
down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.

=93Thought that train would never come,=94 observed the boy.  =93I've wait=
ed
at that station for five hours.=94

=93We had a lot of earthquakes,=94 said Dorothy.  =93Didn't you feel the
ground shake?=94

=93Yes; but we're used to such things in California,=94 he replied.  =93Th=
ey
don't scare us much.=94

=93The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.=94

=93Did he?  Then it must have happened while I was asleep,=94 he said
thoughtfully.

=93How is Uncle Henry?=94 she enquired, after a pause during which the
horse continued to trot with long, regular strides.

=93He's pretty well.  He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.=94

=93Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?=94 she asked.

=93Yes.  Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so
we must be second cousins,=94 said the boy, in an amused tone.  =93I work
for Uncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my
board.=94

=93Isn't that a great deal?=94 she asked, doubtfully.

=93Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me.  I'm a
splendid worker.  I work as well as I sleep,=94 he added, with a laugh.

=93What is your name?=94 said Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner
and the cheery tone of his voice.

=93Not a very pretty one,=94 he answered, as if a little ashamed.  =93My
whole name is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.'  You've been to
Australia, haven't you?=94

=93Yes; with Uncle Henry,=94 she answered.  =93We got to San Francisco a w=
eek
ago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson's Ranch for a visit while
I stayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.=94

=93How long will you be with us?=94 he asked.

=93Only a day.  Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.
We've been away for a long time, you know, and so we're anxious to get
home again.=94

The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked
thoughtful.  Then he started to say something to his little companion,
but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side
to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them.  Next minute there
was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground
open in a wide crack and then come together again.

=93Goodness!=94 she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat.  =93What wa=
s
that?=94

=93That was an awful big quake,=94 replied Zeb, with a white face.  =93It
almost got us that time, Dorothy.=94

The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock.  Zeb shook the
reins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn.  Then the boy cracked
his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan
of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.

Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes.  There was a
breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would
shake violently.  Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and
every muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home.  He
was not going very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to
appear and at times he would tremble like a leaf.

The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds
as it swept over the valley.

Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into
another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.
With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit,
drawing the buggy and its occupants after him.

Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same.
The sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.

Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they
waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for
the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its
dreadful depths.

The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying
noises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the
little girl lost consciousness.  Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but
he was badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,
expecting every moment would be his last.




2.  The Glass City


When Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so
fast.  The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an
umbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated
downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to
bear.  The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this
great crack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was
about to overtake them at any moment.  Crash after crash echoed far
above their heads, as the earth came together where it had split, and
stones and chunks of clay rattled around them on every side.  These
they could not see, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and
Jim screamed almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and
struck his boney body.  They did not really hurt the poor horse,
because everything was falling together; only the stones and rubbish
fell faster than the horse and buggy, which were held back by the
pressure of the air, so that the terrified animal was actually more
frightened than he was injured.

How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,
she was so greatly bewildered.  But bye and bye, as she stared ahead
into the black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the
form of the horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his
long legs sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space.
Also, turning her head, she found that she could see the boy beside
her, who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself.

Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier.  She began to realize
that death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely
started upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and
unusual as were those she had before encountered.

With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over
the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.
Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.
The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.
Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five
brilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one
blue and one orange.  This splendid group of colored suns sent rays
darting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy
and Zeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays
began to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more
and more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly
illuminated.

Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim's big
ears turn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail
should be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the
stripes of a zebra.  Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and
whose hair was pink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.

=93Isn't it funny?=94 she said.

The boy was startled and his eyes were big.  Dorothy had a green streak
through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came
together, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.

=93I--I don't s-s-see any-thing funny--'bout it!=94 he stammered.

Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the
horse tipping also.  But they continued to fall, all together, and the
boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they
were before.  Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll
slowly over until they were right side up again.  During this time Jim
struggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding
himself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of
voice:

=93Well, that's better!=94

Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.

=93Can your horse talk?=94 she asked.

=93Never knew him to, before,=94 replied the boy.

=93Those were the first words I ever said,=94 called out the horse, who ha=
d
overheard them, =93and I can't explain why I happened to speak then.
This is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?=94

=93As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,=94 answered Dorothy,
cheerfully.  =93But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.=94

=93Of course,=94 growled the horse, =93and then we shall be sorry it
happened.=94

Zeb gave a shiver.  All this was so terrible and unreal that he could
not understand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.

Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close
beside them.  The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,
and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.
There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had
passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing
rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.

=93We've got to come to the bottom some time,=94 remarked Zeb, with a deep
sigh.  =93We can't keep falling forever, you know.=94

=93Of course not,=94 said Dorothy.  =93We are somewhere in the middle of t=
he
earth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before
long.  But it's a big hollow, isn't it?=94

=93Awful big!=94 answered the boy.

=93We're coming to something now,=94 announced the horse.

At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked
down.  Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away,
either.  But they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it
could no longer be called a fall--and the children had ample time to
take heart and look about them.

They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very
like those upon the earth's surface; but all the scene was splendidly
colored by the variegated lights from the six suns.  Here and there
were groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they
sparkled so brightly.

=93I'm sure we are in no danger,=94 said Dorothy, in a sober voice.  =93We
are falling so slowly that we can't be dashed to pieces when we land,
and this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.=94

=93We'll never get home again, though!=94 declared Zeb, with a groan.

=93Oh, I'm not so sure of that,=94 replied the girl.  =93But don't let us
worry over such things, Zeb; we can't help ourselves just now, you
know, and I've always been told it's foolish to borrow trouble.=94

The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and
soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread
out below them.  They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a
big city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and
sharp-pointed spires.  These spires were like great spear-points, and
if they tumbled upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious
injury.

Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight
up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense.
But no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a
stop at last.

When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast's legs
trembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped out
of the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he
kicked over Dorothy's bird-cage, which rolled out upon the roof so that
the bottom came off.  At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset
cage, sat down upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round
eyes.

=93Oh,=94 said Dorothy.  =93There's Eureka.=94

=93First time I ever saw a pink cat,=94 said Zeb.

=93Eureka isn't pink; she's white.  It's this queer light that gives her
that color.=94

=93Where's my milk?=94 asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy's face.
=93I'm 'most starved to death.=94

=93Oh, Eureka!  Can you talk?=94

=93Talk!  Am I talking?  Good gracious, I believe I am.  Isn't it funny?=94
asked the kitten.

=93It's all wrong,=94 said Zeb, gravely.  =93Animals ought not to talk.  B=
ut
even old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.=94

=93I can't see that it's wrong,=94 remarked Jim, in his gruff tones.  =93A=
t
least, it isn't as wrong as some other things.  What's going to become
of us now?=94

=93I don't know,=94 answered the boy, looking around him curiously.

The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent
that one could look through the walls as easily as through a window.
Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used
for rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of
queer forms huddled into the corners of these rooms.

The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of
glass were lying scattered in every direction.  A nearby steeple had
been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it.  Other
buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;
but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had
happened to mar their perfection.  The rainbow tints from the colored
suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many
delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.

But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had
arrived, except that of their own voices.  They began to wonder if
there were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner
world.

Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they
were on and stepped into plain view.  He was not a very large man, but
was well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face
of a fine portrait.  His clothing fitted his form snugly and was
gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the
sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.

The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed
the presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly.  There was
no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he
must have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had
rested upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked
rapidly to the furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his
shoulder to gaze at the strange animal.

=93Look out!=94 cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not
look where he was going; =93be careful, or you'll fall off!=94

But he paid no attention to her warning.  He reached the edge of the
tall roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as
calmly as if he were on firm ground.

The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof,
and saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground.
Soon he reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into
one of the glass buildings.

=93How strange!=94 she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.

1.  The Earthquake


The train from 'Frisco was very late.  It should have arrived at
Hugson's Siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the
gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled
up to the open shed that served for the station-house.  As it came to a
stop the conductor called out in a loud voice:

“Hugson's Siding!”

At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the
car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage
covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked
under her arm.  The conductor helped her off the car and then the
engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and
moved slowly away up the track.  The reason he was so late was because
all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and
trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the
rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers.  So
he moved the cars slowly and with caution.

The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared
around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.

The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and
did not look very inviting.  As she peered through the soft gray light
not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any
person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and
buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away.  She walked
toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless,
with its head hanging down almost to the ground.  It was a big horse,
tall and bony, with long legs and large knees and feet.  She could
count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of his body,
and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it
did not fit.  His tail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been
broken in many places and fastened together again with cords and bits
of wire.  The buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side
curtains.  Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the
girl saw a boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.

She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol.
Presently he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes
briskly.

“Hello!” he said, seeing her, “are you Dorothy Gale?”

“Yes,” she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking
gray eyes.  “Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?”

“Of course,” he answered.  “Train in?”

“I couldn't be here if it wasn't,” she said.

He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank.  Jumping out of
the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage
on the floor in front.

“Canary-birds?” he asked.

“Oh no; it's just Eureka, my kitten.  I thought that was the best way
to carry her.”

The boy nodded.

“Eureka's a funny name for a cat,” he remarked.

“I named my kitten that because I found it,” she explained.  “Uncle
Henry says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'”

“All right; hop in.”

She climbed into the buggy and he followed her.  Then the boy picked up
the reins, shook them, and said “Gid-dap!”

The horse did not stir.  Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his
drooping ears, but that was all.

“Gid-dap!” called the boy, again.

The horse stood still.

“Perhaps,” said Dorothy, “if you untied him, he would go.”

The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.

“Guess I'm half asleep yet,” he said, untying the horse.  “But Jim
knows his business all right--don't you, Jim?” patting the long nose of
the animal.

Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at
once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot
down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.

“Thought that train would never come,” observed the boy.  “I've waited
at that station for five hours.”

“We had a lot of earthquakes,” said Dorothy.  “Didn't you feel the
ground shake?”

“Yes; but we're used to such things in California,” he replied.  “They
don't scare us much.”

“The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.”

“Did he?  Then it must have happened while I was asleep,” he said
thoughtfully.

“How is Uncle Henry?” she enquired, after a pause during which the
horse continued to trot with long, regular strides.

“He's pretty well.  He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.”

“Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?” she asked.

“Yes.  Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so
we must be second cousins,” said the boy, in an amused tone.  “I work
for Uncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my
board.”

“Isn't that a great deal?” she asked, doubtfully.

“Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me.  I'm a
splendid worker.  I work as well as I sleep,” he added, with a laugh.

“What is your name?” said Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner
and the cheery tone of his voice.

“Not a very pretty one,” he answered, as if a little ashamed.  “My
whole name is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.'  You've been to
Australia, haven't you?”

“Yes; with Uncle Henry,” she answered.  “We got to San Francisco a week
ago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson's Ranch for a visit while
I stayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.”

“How long will you be with us?” he asked.

“Only a day.  Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.
We've been away for a long time, you know, and so we're anxious to get
home again.”

The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked
thoughtful.  Then he started to say something to his little companion,
but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side
to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them.  Next minute there
was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground
open in a wide crack and then come together again.

“Goodness!” she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat.  “What was
that?”

“That was an awful big quake,” replied Zeb, with a white face.  “It
almost got us that time, Dorothy.”

The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock.  Zeb shook the
reins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn.  Then the boy cracked
his whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan
of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.

Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes.  There was a
breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would
shake violently.  Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and
every muscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home.  He
was not going very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to
appear and at times he would tremble like a leaf.

The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds
as it swept over the valley.

Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into
another great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.
With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit,
drawing the buggy and its occupants after him.

Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same.
The sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.

Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they
waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for
the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its
dreadful depths.

The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying
noises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the
little girl lost consciousness.  Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but
he was badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,
expecting every moment would be his last.




2.  The Glass City


When Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so
fast.  The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an
umbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated
downward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to
bear.  The worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this
great crack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was
about to overtake them at any moment.  Crash after crash echoed far
above their heads, as the earth came together where it had split, and
stones and chunks of clay rattled around them on every side.  These
they could not see, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and
Jim screamed almost like a human being when a stone overtook him and
struck his boney body.  They did not really hurt the poor horse,
because everything was falling together; only the stones and rubbish
fell faster than the horse and buggy, which were held back by the
pressure of the air, so that the terrified animal was actually more
frightened than he was injured.

How long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,
she was so greatly bewildered.  But bye and bye, as she stared ahead
into the black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the
form of the horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his
long legs sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space.
Also, turning her head, she found that she could see the boy beside
her, who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself.

Dorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier.  She began to realize
that death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely
started upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and
unusual as were those she had before encountered.

With this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over
the side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.
Far below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.
The central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.
Around it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five
brilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one
blue and one orange.  This splendid group of colored suns sent rays
darting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy
and Zeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays
began to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more
and more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly
illuminated.

Dorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim's big
ears turn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail
should be yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the
stripes of a zebra.  Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and
whose hair was pink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.

“Isn't it funny?” she said.

The boy was startled and his eyes were big.  Dorothy had a green streak
through the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came
together, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.

“I--I don't s-s-see any-thing funny--'bout it!” he stammered.

Just then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the
horse tipping also.  But they continued to fall, all together, and the
boy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they
were before.  Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll
slowly over until they were right side up again.  During this time Jim
struggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding
himself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of
voice:

“Well, that's better!”

Dorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.

“Can your horse talk?” she asked.

“Never knew him to, before,” replied the boy.

“Those were the first words I ever said,” called out the horse, who had
overheard them, “and I can't explain why I happened to speak then.
This is a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?”

“As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,” answered Dorothy,
cheerfully.  “But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.”

“Of course,” growled the horse, “and then we shall be sorry it
happened.”

Zeb gave a shiver.  All this was so terrible and unreal that he could
not understand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.

Swiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close
beside them.  The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,
and they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.
There was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had
passed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing
rays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.

“We've got to come to the bottom some time,” remarked Zeb, with a deep
sigh.  “We can't keep falling forever, you know.”

“Of course not,” said Dorothy.  “We are somewhere in the middle of the
earth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before
long.  But it's a big hollow, isn't it?”

“Awful big!” answered the boy.

“We're coming to something now,” announced the horse.

At this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked
down.  Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away,
either.  But they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it
could no longer be called a fall--and the children had ample time to
take heart and look about them.

They saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very
like those upon the earth's surface; but all the scene was splendidly
colored by the variegated lights from the six suns.  Here and there
were groups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they
sparkled so brightly.

“I'm sure we are in no danger,” said Dorothy, in a sober voice.  “We
are falling so slowly that we can't be dashed to pieces when we land,
and this country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.”

“We'll never get home again, though!” declared Zeb, with a groan.

“Oh, I'm not so sure of that,” replied the girl.  “But don't let us
worry over such things, Zeb; we can't help ourselves just now, you
know, and I've always been told it's foolish to borrow trouble.”

The boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and
soon both were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread
out below them.  They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a
big city which had many tall buildings with glass domes and
sharp-pointed spires.  These spires were like great spear-points, and
if they tumbled upon one of them they were likely to suffer serious
injury.

Jim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight
up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense.
But no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a
stop at last.

When Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast's legs
trembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped out
of the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he
kicked over Dorothy's bird-cage, which rolled out upon the roof so that
the bottom came off.  At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset
cage, sat down upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round
eyes.

“Oh,” said Dorothy.  “There's Eureka.”

“First time I ever saw a pink cat,” said Zeb.

“Eureka isn't pink; she's white.  It's this queer light that gives her
that color.”

“Where's my milk?” asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy's face.
“I'm 'most starved to death.”

“Oh, Eureka!  Can you talk?”

“Talk!  Am I talking?  Good gracious, I believe I am.  Isn't it funny?”
asked the kitten.

“It's all wrong,” said Zeb, gravely.  “Animals ought not to talk.  But
even old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.”

“I can't see that it's wrong,” remarked Jim, in his gruff tones.  “At
least, it isn't as wrong as some other things.  What's going to become
of us now?”

“I don't know,” answered the boy, looking around him curiously.

The houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent
that one could look through the walls as easily as through a window.
Dorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used
for rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of
queer forms huddled into the corners of these rooms.

The roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of
glass were lying scattered in every direction.  A nearby steeple had
been broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it.  Other
buildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;
but they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had
happened to mar their perfection.  The rainbow tints from the colored
suns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many
delicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.

But not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had
arrived, except that of their own voices.  They began to wonder if
there were no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner
world.

Suddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they
were on and stepped into plain view.  He was not a very large man, but
was well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face
of a fine portrait.  His clothing fitted his form snugly and was
gorgeously colored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the
sunbeams touched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.

The man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed
the presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly.  There was
no expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he
must have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had
rested upon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked
rapidly to the furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his
shoulder to gaze at the strange animal.

“Look out!” cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not
look where he was going; “be careful, or you'll fall off!”

But he paid no attention to her warning.  He reached the edge of the
tall roof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as
calmly as if he were on firm ground.

The girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof,
and saw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground.
Soon he reached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into
one of the glass buildings.

“How strange!” she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.
