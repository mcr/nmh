nmh is known to compile on the following platforms (save the
exceptions noted below), using an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc.

AIX 4.1.5.0.01
Cygwin (setup version 2.763, other versions may be fine)
FreeBSD
IRIX 6.5
Linux 2.2 to current (glibc 2.1 to current)
Mac OS X
NetBSD 1.4.2
OpenBSD
Solaris 7 and 8 (sparc,x86)
SunOS 4.1

Known Compilation problems:
--------------------------------------
FreeBSD:
OpenBSD:
NetBSD:

Some BSD4.4 machines have problems when running nmh's configure script.
They will be unable to find the location of vi and sendmail.  This is
due to POSIX features (breakage?) in the shell sh.  The solution is to
run the configure script under the shell `bash':

    % bash configure

--------------------------------------
Mac OS X/Rhapsody 5:

Version 5.3 at least has the same sh/bash bug as the *BSD systems
above. This appears to be fixed in 5.5.

Will not compile correctly unless you configure with the --enable-debug
option. It appears to find conflicts in the headers only when debugging
is disabled. With debugging enabled, it compiles and runs happily.

--------------------------------------
Cygwin:

Be sure to install Cygwin package libncurses-devel, in the Devel or
Libs category.  And libncurses10 or later in the Lib category.

You may notice a few (three) compile warnings:  they can be ignored.

--------------------------------------
HPUX:

Lots of problems have been reported with using HPUX `cc'.  In particular,
problems with `scan' giving incorrect dates (everything is 01/00).
It is highly recommended that you use `gcc' instead.

Also, new versions of HPUX (10.20?) will core dump in `scan' because
of some workaround code in zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.  This workaround is
needed for older versions of HPUX, but causes problems on newer versions.
The solution is the added line (minus our indentation):

    #undef hpux

after line 15 of the file zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.

--------------------------------------
Irix (SGI):

Irix make is notoriously buggy. If you're using it, you should "touch
config.h.in" before configuring to prevent a problem where it tries to
rebuild targets that shouldn't be rebuilt. (Alternately, you can just
use GNU make instead of Irix make.)

--------------------------------------
Linux:

The configuration script does a test to discover if your vi is broken
(if it reports non-zero exit codes on certain pseudo-errors).  This test
will hang if the program `ex' on your system is a link to the vi clone
`vile'.  The workaround is to replace the command ex as a link to another
vi clone such as nvi or elvis.

--------------------------------------
Solaris:

With --enable-debug you'll see a lot of warnings. This is even worse
when compiling using the Sun Workshop compiler since it issues a
warning for every instance of a problem instead of summarizing them.
The main one concerns arrays with an index of type char. This is ok.
The array itself is a hash of chars, so the array size and the type
match. There isn't another safe and portable way to do this at the
moment. An explicit cast would get rid of the warnings, but I think
it's better to leave it complaining for now until we come up with
a better solution. The whole thing is probablly going to be chucked
with UTF-8 support anyway.

Other than the warnings, it builds ok.
--------------------------------------
SunOS 4.1.1/4.1.3/4.1.4:

You can't use the C compiler that comes with SunOS 4 since
it isn't ANSI C.  But nmh builds just fine with gcc. With
--enable-debug you will see a lot of warnings.
