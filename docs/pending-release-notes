Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- builds use OpenSSL if available.
- post now defaults to port 587 on 'smtp' message submission.
- A value of 0 for the width switch of scan(1), inc(1), ap(1), dp(1),
  fmttest(1), and mhl(1) now means as many characters as the format
  engine can produce [Bug #15274].  That amount is limited by internal
  buffers.
- If a component has trailing whitespace, e.g., body:component="> ",
  mhl now trims that whitespace off when filtering blank text lines.
- An "rtrim" flag has been added to mhl to remove any trailing
  whitespace from filtered text lines.  A corresponding "nortrim" flag
  has also been added.
- The default locations for configuration files and suppoooort binaries
  have been changed.  Configuration files now install into ${sysconfdir}/nmh,
  and support binaries are placed in ${libexecdir}/nmh.  If you are upgrading
  an existing installation you should look for old configuration files in
  ${sysconfdir} and merge any local customizations into the new files in
  ${sysconfdir}/nmh, then remove the old files.  ${libdir} will also contain
  obsolete support programs that should be removed.
- When building from source, configure will derive ${prefix} from an existing
  nmh installation if it finds one in your $PATH.
- Added getmymbox and getmyaddr mh-format(5) function escapes.
- New -[no]changecur, -fixtype, -decodetypes, and -[no]crlflinebreaks switches
  have been added to mhfixmsg(1).
- mhfixmsg now removes an extraneous trailing semicolon from header
  parameter lists.
- Added -convertargs switch to repl(1), to pass arguments to programs
  specified in the user's profile or mhn.defaults to convert message
  content.
- Added mhical(1), to display, reply to, and cancel iCalendar (RFC 5545)
  event requests.
- added multiply format function
- "mhparam bindir" prints the path to the directory containing the public
  executables (${bindir}).
- new "-prefer" switch for mhshow (and mhlist and mhshow), to allow specifying
  the preferred content types to show, if present in a multipart alternative.
- mh-format now has %(kilo) and %(kibi) functions, to allow printing
  numbers as, for example, "10K", or "2.3Mi"
- Support for the -sendmail flag to send/post to change the sendmail
  binary when using the sendmail/pipe MTS.
- Added support to send(1) to specify switches to post(1) based on address or
  domain name in From: header line in message draft.
- post(8) -snoop now attempts to decode base64-encoded SMTP traffic.
- folder(1) -nocreate now prints a warning message for a non-existant folder.
- mhfixmsg(1) now allows -decodetext binary, though 8bit is still the default.
- inc(1) and msgchk(1) now support TLS encryption natively.
- Support for SMTPUTF8 (RFC 6531) has been added.  mhshow(1) already supported
  RFC 6532, assuming all 8-bit message header field bodies are UTF-8 and use
  of a UTF-8 locale.
- mhfixmsg now replaces RFC 2047 encoding with RFC 2231 encoding of name and
  filename parameters in Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers,
  respectively.
- If a message body contains 8-bit bytes, post(8) uses SMTP 8BITMIME if the
  server supports it.  If not, post fails with a message to the user to
  encode the message for 7-bit transport.
- Added welcome message when nmh detects that its version changed.

-----------------
OBSOLETE FEATURES
-----------------

- The undocumented -queue switch to post was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was
  removed in this release.
- conflict(8) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- mhtest(8) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- msh(1) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- Support in alias files for the the "*" address-group (everyone) was
  deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.

-------------------
DEPRECATED FEATURES
-------------------

- Support for the MHPDEBUG environment variable is deprecated and will be
  removed from a future nmh release.  Instead, use the -debug switch to pick.
- With the move of support binaries from ${libdir} to ${libexecdir}/nmh, the
  mostly undocumented 'libdir' mhparam(1) component has been replaced by a
  new 'libexecdir' component.  'libdir' will be removed in a future release.

---------
BUG FIXES
---------

- The format scanner no longer subtracts 1 from the width.  This has the
  effect of no longer counting the trailing newline in the output of
  scan(1), inc(1), and the other programs that rely on the format scanner.
- The first character of some very short (less than 4 characters) message
  bodies is no longer dropped.
- mhfixmsg now adds a Content-Transfer-Encoding header at the message level,
  if needed after decoding text parts.
- mhbuild now checks whether all text parts need a Content-Transfer-Encoding
  header, not just those with a character set not specified.
