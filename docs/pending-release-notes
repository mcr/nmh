Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

- SASL security layers (encryption) are now supported for the SMTP MTA.
- You can now select the SMTP server and port from either "send" or a
  user's mh_profile (you could always select the server; that option is
  now documented).  These are available via the -server and -port switches.
- All networking code has been modified to use the new networking APIs
  (getaddrinfo and friends).  All networking code (with the exception of
  the ftp client) now supports IPv6.
- Support for prefixing a \01 in the "servers" entry in mts.conf to
  connect to all servers on a particular named net has been removed.
- New commands 'new', 'fnext', 'fprev', and 'unseen' for showing folders with
  unseen mail (or mail in any specified sequence), changing to next such
  folder, changing to previous such folder, and scanning all such folders,
  respectively.  This is based on Luke Mewburn's 'new':

- nmh will no longer attempt to install a mhn.defaults file that causes mhshow
  to open its own xterms.
