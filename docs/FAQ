  This is a living list of frequently asked questions on the mailer
  user interface, Mail Handler, or MH. The point of this is to
  circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers.
  Better to build on top than start again. Please read this document
  before ever posting to this newsgroup.

  This article is posted monthly. If it has already expired and you're
  not reading this, you can hope that you saved the instructions to
  retrieve the FAQ (see "Where can I get MH") so that you can get a
  copy through other means.

  Please do not post an answer when someone posts a frequently asked
  question; rather, email the relevant section of the FAQ to eliminate
  unnecessary traffic in this newsgroup.

  This list depends on your comments, additions and fixes: please send
  them to Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>.

  To skip to a particular question with Subject or number xx, use
  "/^S.*xx" with most pagers. In GNU Emacs type "M-C-s ^S.*xx", (or
  C-r to search backwards), followed by ESC to end the search.

  To skip to new or changed questions, use "/^S.*[!+]" with most
  pagers and "M-C-s ^S.*[!+]" in GNU Emacs.

  This article is in digest format. nn may have already broken this
  message into separate articles; if not, then type "G %". In rn, use
  ^G to skip sections.

  This article is treated as an outline when edited by GNU Emacs. Run
  "M-x describe-mode" to see available outline-mode commands. Useful
  commands are "M-x hide-body", "C-c C-s" (show-subtree) and "M-x
  show-all"

  Check out the Usenet Hypertext FAQ Archive (see "What references
  exist for nn?"). Files available by ftp, man pages, and other Web
  pages, as well as cross-references like the one in this paragraph
  are just a click away.

  A "Date" field whose time is 00:00:00 is approximate. The month and
  year in these fields represent the time they were added to the FAQ,
  rather than when they were contributed by the author, as is the case
  since November, 1995.

  If you should need the Internet address, use nslookup or dig if you
  have them, or send mail to <dns at grasp.insa-lyon.fr> with "help"
  for a Subject.

  References to $MHLIB refer to the directory that contains MH support
  files and routines. This directory is usually /usr/lib/mh or
  /usr/local/lib/mh (or /usr/local/nmh/lib or /etc/nmh for nmh). Do
  not use $MHLIB literally; use the real, absolute path to your MH
  library directory.

  There are slight differences between the original MH and nmh. In the
  text, the nmh command or filename is preferred, and the MH
  equivalent is placed in parenthesis. For example, the MH
  configuration is in $MHLIB/mts.conf (mtstailor); mhshow (mhn -show)
  is used to view attachments.

  Note that due to bottom feeding email address harvesting spam scum,
  mailto links have been removed and @s in addresses have been
  replaced by "at."

Subject: 01.01 Why should I use MH?
From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  The MH message handling system is a set of electronic mail programs
  in the public domain. If your computer runs Unix, it can probably
  run MH.

  The big difference between MH and most other "mail user agents" is
  that you can use MH from a Unix shell prompt. In MH, each command is
  a separate program, and the shell is used as an interpreter. So, all
  the power of Unix shells (pipes, redirection, history, aliases, and
  so on) works with MH--you don't have to learn a new interface. Other
  mail agents have their own command interpreter for their individual
  mail commands (although the mush mail agent simulates a Unix shell).

  Because MH commands aren't part of a monolithic mail system, you can
  use them at any time; you don't have to start or quit the mail
  agent. Because you use them from a shell prompt, you can use all the
  power of the shell.

  If your shell has time-saving aliases or functions (and most do),
  you'll be able to use them with MH, of course. And because MH isn't
  a monolithic mail agent, you can use MH commands in Unix shell
  scripts, or call them from programs in high-level languages like C.

  Unlike most mail agents, MH keeps each message in a separate file.
  The filename is the message number. To rearrange the messages, MH
  just changes the filenames. MH can use standard Unix file system
  operations such as removing, copying and linking messages. The
  message files are grouped into one or more folders, which are
  actually Unix directories.

  MH is free, powerful, flexible--and the basics are easy to learn.

Subject: !01.02 What is the current version/status of MH.
From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Sun, 23 Sep 2007 23:51:52 -0700

  The current official version of MH is 6.8.3, although a beta of
  6.8.4 is available.

  This version includes MIME, a multi-media MH package that implements
  the new IETF work on Multi-media 822 (MIME). This allows you to
  include things like audio, graphics, and the like, in your mail
  messages. --Marshall Rose <mrose at dbc.mtview.ca.us>

  MH now works with Kerberos as well.

  In addition, a new program called mhparam extracts arguments from
  .mh_profile which is useful in shell scripts.

  Please see the file CHANGES in the distribution for more details.

  Due to the languishing state of MH, Richard Coleman <coleman at
  math.gatech.edu> created another version of MH called nmh based upon
  MH 6.8.3. He added GNU autoconf to ease installation considerably
  and fixed several bugs and inconsistencies. Doug Morris <doug at
  mhost.com. hosted the web site, mailing lists, web pages, and CVS
  repository for a long time. Ken Hornstein <kenh at pobox.com> picked
  up the torch in 2002 and moved development to Savannah where Jon
  Steinhart <nmh at fourwinds.com> joined him as a project maintainer.
  See http://www.nongnu.org/nmh/. The stable version of nmh is 1.5.
  The file docs/DIFFERENCES in the nmh distribution contains a list of
  differences between nmh and MH.

  GNU mailutils (version 2.99.97) is a collection of mail-related
  utilities. At the core of mailutils is libmailbox, a library which
  provides access to various forms of mailbox files (including remote
  mailboxes via popular protocols and MH). See
  http://www.gnu.org/software/mailutils/.

Subject: 01.05 What other MH software is available?

  MH-E is the Emacs interface to the MH mail system. It offers all the
  functionality of MH, the visual orientation and simplicity of use of
  a GUI, and full integration with Emacs and XEmacs, including
  thorough configuration and online help.

  MH-E allows one to read and process mail very quickly: many commands
  are single characters; completion and smart defaults are used for
  folder names and aliases. With MH-E you compose outgoing messages in
  Emacs. This is a big plus for Emacs users, but even non-Emacs users
  have been known to use MH-E after only learning the most basic
  cursor motion commands.

  Additional features include:

      * attractive text rendering with font lock
      * composition and display of MIME body parts
      * display of images and HTML within the Emacs frame
      * folder browsing with speedbar
      * threading
      * ticking messages
      * lightning-fast full-text indexed searches of all of your email
      * virtual folders to view ticked and unseen messages, search results
      * multiple personalities
      * signing and encrypting
      * spam filter interaction
      * XFace, Face, X-Image-URL header field support with picons

  The GNU Emacs distribution includes MH-E.

  MH-E is maintained at SourceForge:

  The terminal-oriented, fast, and powerful mutt mail client not only
  supports the MH mail format but also supports .mh_sequences files,
  providing a robust interface to MH. It is also amazingly
  configurable and is very adept at handling MIME attachments and HTML
  mail.

  Unlike MH, the displayed message numbers do not necessarily
  correspond to the message filenames. This makes threading and
  sorting lightning fast but slower to display very large folders.

  display with one label per folder, clever scan caching, facesaver
  bitmap display; background inc, various inc styles, searching over
  folder listing and message body, a dialog-box interface to MH pick,
  a simple built-in emacs-like editor, interfaces to other editors,
  user preferences, user hacking support. For more info or to obtain

  Vmh is designed for people using the bulletin-board features of MH,
  where mail is stored in packed (single-file) folders. As a result,
  use of this program cannot be mixed with the use of normal MH
  commands. Vmh is a part of the official MH distribution.

  Xmh is a X11 mouse-based MH browsing tool. It is very powerful and
  feature-filled and thus comes with a moderate learning curve. Its
  dependence on the X11 environment makes it very reconfigurable, but
  only by people well-versed in X applications programming. Its
  message reply built-in-editor interface is not always popular among
  those used to having MH bring up the editor of their choice.

  xmh is part of the standard X Window System distribution from the X
  Consortium. Ultrix also ships dxmail which is similar.

  Metamail is a package that can be used to convert virtually ANY
  mail-reading program on Unix into a multi-media mail-reading
  program. It is an extremely generic implementation of MIME
  (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), the proposed standard for
  multi-media mail formats on the Internet. The implementation is
  extremely flexible and extensible, using a "mailcap" file mechanism
  for adding support for new data formats when sent through the mail.
  At a heterogeneous site where many mail readers are in use, the
  mailcap mechanism can be used to extend them all to support new
  types of multi-media mail by a single addition to a mailcap file.

  The metamail distribution comes complete with a small patch for each
  of over a dozen popular mail reading programs, including Berkeley
  mail, mh, Elm, Xmh, Xmail, Mailtool, Emacs Rmail, Emacs VM, Andrew,
  and others. Note that the MH patches are now integrated into MH 6.8.

  Plum is a highly configurable and extensible screen-oriented
  front-end for processing MH mail on ASCII terminals. Unlike MH-E,
  the extension language used in plum is perl, not LISP. Plum offers
  many of the advantages of xmh, but lacks several of xmh's

  Mhunify is a set of perl scripts and templates that provides
  shell-level MH functionality with USENET news. Since MH supports
  MIME, MIME-format news articles just work. I've found that being
  able to handle news in the same way that I handle email is very
  useful, although there are some tradeoffs.

  Mhunify also treats MH folders just like news groups. If you
  subscribe to several mailing lists, and your email is automatically
  delivered to separate folders, say, via procmail or via MMDF's
  .maildelivery, the mhunify package lets you progress automatically
  through your folders just as you would news groups.

  Vmail is a curses-based, vi-like message browser which calls on MH
  programs to manipulate mail. It can be used on almost any terminal.
  It organizes mail folders into index pages, from which a message can
  be selected to be shown, replied-to, forwarded, refiled, deleted,
  and so on. The vi-like interface and command keystrokes are
  comfortable to less-experienced Unix users, and it is a small,
  compact program, unlike the MH-E Emacs package.

  This version of vmail has been bugfixed and enhanced from the
  original vmail published on the net in 1987 by J. Zobel.

  Qmh is an MH-based group mail management tool. Written entirely in
  perl, Qmh combines the best aspects of MH with group mail heuristics
  and delivers a sensible package for all levels of Unix users. A
  limitless number of individual queues and associated groups of
  permitted users can be established.

  Specific functionality includes the following modes of operation;
  checking header dates and sending reminder/deadline mail, editing
  existing messages, help screens, creating new messages from scratch
  or exiting messages, resolving messages, scanning queue folders, and
  annotating with status both by editing and sending mail.

  Qmh is a single generic program in and of itself from which all
  modes of operation are invoked. Additionally, each separate queue
  may be accessed via a link to the single program. All system
  configuration is maintained in a single file that is read upon each
  invocation of Qmh. Formatting and template files are provided in the
  system library, although individual users can override the defaults
  simply by creating equivalent files in their own MH mail directory.

  Qmh provides a powerful database-like functionality by allowing
  limitless per-queue X-Qmh-<$value> headers to be included in
  messages. These "fields" then form the context of the queue messages
  and provide a user-defined, but yet structured environment for
  queries, reporting, and random information.

  Qmh is designed to provide a complete solution for SA groups, help
  desks, support organizations, or wherever two or more individuals
  are trying to manage multiple mail requests.

  Qmh is also compatible with versions of xmh that provide user-level
  command buttons. Provided in the Qmh package is a ~/.Xdefaults
  template file that's setup to harness the power of Qmh.

  which includes tutorials and man pages. If the doc directory is
  empty or is missing the Makefile, you'll have to run "mhconfig MH"
  in the conf directory so that the documentation with correct local

  For properly formatting the documentation (at least the manual

  The unrmail function will convert rmail format to mbox format.

From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  If you use one of a mail agent like 'mail', 'mailx', 'elm' or
  'mush', converting to MH is easy. When you run the 'inc' command, it
  reads all new messages from the system mailbox into your 'inbox'
  folder. Those mail agents also have separate files or "folders" that
  hold messages in the same format as the system mailbox. You can read
  them with the 'inc -file' command. For example, to read the messages
  from your 'mbox' mail file into your MH 'inbox' folder, you'd type:

    % cd
    % cp mbox mbox.backup
    % inc -file mbox

  If you see the usual "Incorporating new mail into inbox..." message
  and a scan listing, the messages probably were converted. Read some
  or all of them (with the 'show' command) and be sure. The 'inc'
  won't remove your mbox unless you use '-truncate'.

  You can also specify an alternate folder to inc. Here's how you can

    done

  Section D.4 of the MH book's second edition lists two scripts to

  BABYL format; vmsmail2mh to convert from VMS's mail (see "What

  You can remove the second to last second line ("> $input"), so that
  the script doesn't zero out your RMAIL file.

  Another alternative is to replace this line with "inc -file $tmpmbox
  $folder && > $input", so that the RMAIL is only zeroed if inc
  successfully incorporated the mail. Finally one could add a switch
  -z, so that the RMAIL file is only zeroed if the switch is given.

  If you're using Linux, you can simply install the nmh or MH package
  which is available in most distributions.

  If you want to build nmh, follow the directions in the file named
  INSTALL. Basically, it's simply "./configure; make; make install."

  If you have MH on the other hand, if you carefully read the file
  named READ-ME in the root of the source hierarchy, you should not
  have any trouble building MH.

  If you're having troubles building MH, it could be that the problem
  has already been fixed, but hasn't yet gotten into an official
  release. Please see http://www.gw.com/mail/mh/patches/ for more

Subject: 02.03 What options should I use?
From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Tue, 1 Dec 1992 00:00:00 -0800

  BERK: Do NOT include the BERK option (in versions 6.7 or later)!
  BERK breaks the mh-format functions that take apart address lines,
  for example mbox, from, and friendly. This would really put a crimp
  on my replcomps file.

  LOCKF: if you have NFS, you need to lock your mailbox with lockf()
  so the lock will be honored by all machines on the local network. If
  you have the lockf() system call, include LOCKF.

  JQ Johnson <jqj at duff.uoregon.edu> makes the point that one should
  use this option carefully since it requires a robust lockf() call.
  For example, this option caused serious problems on his SunOS 4.1.1.
  He suggested using LOK_BELL instead, and adding "lockstyle: 1" to
  $MHLIB/mts.conf (mtstailor).

  ATZ: makes your timezones print like "EST" instead of "-0500". Much
  prettier. --Stephen Gildea <gildea at stop.mail-abuse.org>

  However, Tony Landells <ahl at technix.oz.au> replies: "Yes; very
  pretty. How unfortunate that timezone names are so ambiguous, so
  that EST can be interpreted, at a minimum, as (American) Eastern
  Standard Time, (Australian) Eastern Standard Time, or (Australian)
  Eastern Summer Time (and yes, I think it's dumb having the same
  acronym for both normal and Summer time, but that's a different
  problem). While the numeric timezones may not look as nice, they
  are, at least, reasonably unambiguous. I would urge anyone who ever
  intends/hopes/expects to use email outside the U.S. to NOT use ATZ
  (sorry Stephen)."

  At any rate, the conf/examples directory has been updated and
  contains many examples show you which options are required on your
  platform and which are optional (in the upcoming version MH 6.8). At
  any rate, it is recommended that you examine the options in the
  example configuration files, and read about them in READ-ME.

  RPATHS: a side-effect is that slocal writes messages to your system
  maildrop without the MMDF C-A's that separate messages, so your BSD
  tools like from work.

  Run exmh on the laptop, and modify your .mh_profile to inc using

  modify MH-E a wee bit to allow it to prompt for the password. You
  would likely have to do something similar with exmh.)

  As a spare time project I'm adding enough IMAP support to MH (6.8.3)
  to allow you to 'inc -imap [-imapfolder foo]'. If I ever get this
  done I'll stick the diffs up somewhere. (It's not a big priority as
  I can get at my IMAP INBOX using APOP.)

  We are developing fmh and intend to support as much of MH as is
  feasible. However, MH and IMAP don't necessarily agree as to what
  things are going to look like. MH has static message numbers until
  you pack a folder; IMAP keeps two numbers on a message, one which is
  absolutely static and one which is relative to the top of a mailbox.
  Messages in IMAP are essentially immutable. IMAP doesn't (currently)
  allow message annotations. fmh will keep state with a background
  daemon instead of writing it to disk, and will probably try and keep
  as little on disk as possible.

  fmh doesn't understand MH folders at the moment, and probably won't
  for a really long time, if ever. As I said before, we're mostly
  interested in the IMAP aspects as we're using a networked file
  system and saving stuff on the local disk just isn't an option.

  fmh is not MH at a very fundamental level. It is very unlikely that
  it will be merged, as we're not quite as interested in creating
  something that is MH and IMAP as we are in writing a good IMAP
  client. Also, the MH code isn't going to take the introduction of
  IMAP without a near complete rewrite.

  It is not available yet. Inquiries are welcome at <tjs+fmh at
  andrew.cmu.edu>.

  What prevents people from doing a telnet to their mail server,
  logging in, and firing up MH directly? Site policy? An operating
  system that does not let MH compile or run? Overloaded machine with
  insufficient processing power for MH? All these are site-specific
  problems and the solution lies in solving them locally, not in
  forcing MH to go over IMAP.

  IMAP was never designed to emulate a filesytem. MH was designed to
  make direct advantage of the filesytem structure. There is no
  compatibility between the two. By the time IMAP is revised enough to
  support MH you will have reinvented NFS.

  There *is* scope for redesign here, though. It would be nice to have
  a single-user filesystem. Create a binary telnet session to the
  filesystem server, log in as yourself, and then over that session
  run a filesystem protocol. Normal filesystem protections at the
  other end will be sufficient for all permissions checking, so the
  filesystem protocol would need to do no other permissions checking.
  The question of whom to export directories to would go away: They
  are exported to whoever completes a successful login, and accessible
  to the user if he would be able to access them on the server as his
  login id. You could even use challenge-response for the initial
  login, coupled with ssh-based encryption, so you automatically have
  a secure filesystem without even trying.

  IMAP is too restricted in its scope to be easily modifiable to
  emulate such a filesystem. It would have to be a redesign from
  scratch.

  No. MH only supports retrieving mail using POP3. POP3 is on the
  "standards track"--it is now an elective Internet Draft Standard
  (see RFC 1939 for more details). At this point, IMAP[23] are
  "experimental, limited use" protocols; it is unlikely that MH will
  support them.

From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Sun, 8 Sep 1996 15:45:32 -0700

  Since John posted the message above, IMAP has progressed from an
  "experiemental, limited use" protocol. While IMAP is not universal,
  many vendors now have implementations.

  I've found several things which might help. First, a definition
  lifted from the Pine FAQ:

  What is IMAP?

  IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client
  program on any platform at any location on the Internet can access
  email folders on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be
  local, they reside on the server until the client explicitly moves
  or deletes them. The IMAP protocol is a superset of POP, containing
  all POP commands plus more. For a comparison of IMAP and POP, see
  the paper Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP
  vs. POP (in ftp.cac.washington.edu:/mail/imap.vs.pop). IMAP is what
  allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to get to email on a central
  campus email server. There are current IETF working groups revising
  IMAP and readying it to become an Internet standard. A copy of the
  latest IMAP draft may be obtained from:
  
    ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/latest-imap-draft

  For a list of IMAP clients, see the file imap.software, in the same
  directory.

  ipop3d from the UW IMAP toolkit can operate in a couple modes. As a
  straight POP3 server, it uses the same C-client library as imapd, so
  it co-exists comfortably with imapd. It can also operate as a
  POP-to-IMAP gateway so that your POP-only clients can access IMAP
  services.

  The only answer I can give for [how MH users can use IMAP] is that

  future develop a version of MH that can use IMAP.

Subject: 02.06 Why does "mailgroup mail" only affect inc but not slocal?
From: John Romine <jromine at ics.uci.edu>
Date: Fri, 1 Jan 1993 00:00:00 -0800

  If "mailgroup" is set, inc is made set-group-id to this group name.
  Some SYS5 systems want this to be set to "mail". Set this if
  /usr/spool/mail (or /usr/mail) is not world-writable. These changes
  were contributed by Peter Marvit, and "inc" is very careful about
  its use of the set-gid privilege.

  Note that slocal doesn't know how to deal with this, and will not
  work under these systems; just making it set-group-id will open a
  security hole (since it doesn't know when to drop the set-gid
  privileges). If you're using "mailgroup", you should remove slocal
  (and its man page) from your system.

  Alternatives to slocal include deliver, procmail, and mailagent.

  The current patch is the first one listed below. The old patch only
  works with libc-4.4, which is no longer used. The current patch is
  split into two pieces, as with the previous patch, but now the
  divisions are purely functional: the first diff enables MH to
  compile, the second allows creation of a shared library. [The paths
  are up to date, but I think the info in this paragraph is old. --Ed]

  Recent versions of GNU make choke on MH's makefiles. Unfortunately,
  the shared library patches depend on "export". If you have problems
  building MH, remove the "export" lines from all of the makefiles (if
  you applied the shared library patches) and try using BSD pmake
  instead.

  If you don't want to compile MH, the second file contains
  pre-compiled ready-to-run binaries which can simply be extracted in
  the root directory.

From: Ted Remillard <tedr at hood.sd.com>

  You can get MH to stop managing the headers and let the email server
  to do it. To do this, build MH with the options DUMB and REALLYDUMB.
  In the $MHLIB/mts.conf (mtstailor) file, set the server option to
  the IP address of the email server. After this is done, MH sends
  email directly to the email server and Local email To: and From:
  fields just have the user's simple email address, e.g., <fred>, and
  the remote email From: header will contain user@domainname, e.g.,
  <fred@sd.com>.

  Don't forget to define the REALLYDUMB option in the file
  sbr/addrsbr.c described below.

From: Bret Rothenberg <bretr at endeavour.exar.com>

  If you're behind a firewall and sendmail gives you fits because MH
  adds the node name or site name to each address in the To: and CC:
  fields, you'll need to modify the MH source.

  The relevant source has to do with the REALLYDUMB option in
  sbr/addrsbr.c. Essentially what you need to do is set it up so
  REALLYDUMB is turned on (normally, it's turned off if you have MMDF
  or SMTP turned on). This will do what you want. I did this at our
  site, and it's been working great. The stuff for REALLYDUMB starts
  around line 613.

  The MH Patch Archive has been opened at

    http://www.gw.com/mail/mh/patches/

  It is a collection of patches to MH (the RAND MH Message Handling
  System), a set of electronic mail programs in the public domain.
  Since the last complete release of MH (version 6.8.3) UNIX systems
  have evolved making changes in the MH code necessary. Several new
  UNIX systems have emerged requiring new configuration templates and
  examples. This archive tries to collect all these fixes and
  enhancements that in the past have been available only through
  word-of-mouth and occasional reposts to newsgroups or mailing lists.

  The initial archive layout and the very time consuming collecting
  and categorizing of patches has been done by Jerry Peek.

  I will be the primary maintainer of the archive. Even though I will
  be monitoring several sources for new material (mainly the
  comp.mail.mh newsgroup but also the mailing lists <mh-workers at
  ics.uci.edu>, <mh-e-users at lists.sourceforge.net> and
  <exmh-workers at redhat.com>), I'd like to encourage everyone to
  submit patches also directly to the archive at <mh-archive at

  The University of Washington POP3 and IMAP servers can be backended

  Netscape's store, curiously enough. I haven't looked closely at how
  Mark Crispin implemented support for the new IMAP4 features when
  using an MH backend; it seems like there is a lot of computation
  when opening a folder for the first time, writing in the UID fields
  and such. But it basically appears to work.

  That's a very old version. delete/expunge has been in imap-4.x for a

  This includes the patched source with binaries pre-built.

  I just remembered that I also had to hack the makefiles to get
  things to install since windoze executables have to end with .exe. I
  hacked the generated makefiles, so if you rerun configure, you may
  lose the hacks. Also, I believe the install will fail when trying to
  install the documentation, so to force things do:

    make -i install

  The binaries and support files should get installed (under
  /usr/local/nmh), but the docs probably won't.

  Then you will need to edit /usr/local/nmh/etc/mts.conf to reflect
  your local configuration.

  If anyone has any problems installing, I could zip up my
  /usr/local/nmh since I think it contains everything needed for
  runtime usage.

Subject: 03.02 How would one go about reading Usenet with MH?
From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Sun, 26 Nov 1995 12:32:09 -0800

  You can post via mail. Send your article to <mail2news at
  news.demon.co.uk> with a legitimate Newsgroups field.

From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: Tue, 1 Nov 1994 00:00:00 -0800

  You can save articles in the news readers for later perusal with MH.

  First, create a symbolic link from your mail directory (e.g.,
  usenet) to your news directory (e.g., "ln -s ~/News ~/Mail/usenet").
  You can then treat your news directory as a mail folder. Thus, to
  select a news group, use "folder +usenet/comp/mail/mh".

  To set the default save location correctly in rn, use:

    rn -M -/

  or in your nn presentation sequence:

    news.announce.		+$F/$N
    comp.mail.mh		+
    .
    .

  If there's news spooled on your machine (that is, not via NNTP) then
  you can read a newsgroup with commands like:

    show first +/usr/spool/news/comp/mail/mh
    next
    ...

  You can also use sequences to keep track of what you've read. MH
  will automatically set a "cur" sequence in each newsgroup you read
  that way. So, to continue reading the newsgroup sometime later,
  after you've read some other folder, you can do:

    next +/usr/spool/news/comp/mail/mh

  and you'll read the next (new) article (if any) in that newsgroup.

  Note that this can eventually make your private context file pretty
  huge; if there's a group you don't read often, you can remove its
  context entries with a command like:

    rmf +/usr/spool/news/comp/mail/mh

  Don't try that on a folder full of mail (a folder that isn't
  read-only), though... in that case, it'll remove all the messages!

  I haven't looked into posting. It seems like it shouldn't be hard.
  You could set up a "sendproc" that would look at outgoing email
  messages. If the message had a Newsgroups: header field, your
  sendproc could call inews(1) instead of post(8). I haven't seen much
  in the MH manpages or documentation about sendprocs (though I
  haven't looked for a couple of years...). See the "mysend" script in
  the MH book section 7.1.4 (13.13), or the URL:

    http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/mh/senove.html#ASAtDm

  A threaded news reader like trn or tin is so much nicer, though,
  that reading news with MH may not be worth the hassle.

Subject: 03.05 Why doesn't "show" display all of a MIME message?
From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: Mon, 1 Aug 1994 00:00:00 -0800

  It's not the fault of the "show" command or of MH in general. It's
  your system's configuration. Check the $MHLIB/mhn.defaults
  (mhn_defaults) file; if it doesn't have defaults for all content
  types, add them. Or, if you can't (or shouldn't) change mhn.defaults
  (mhn_defaults), you can put default entries in your MH profile file
  for those content types.

  Here's the part of the mhshow(1) (mhn(1)) manpage that explains how
  content types are handled. The example is for mhshow, but if you're
  using mhn, you'd replace mhshow with mhn:

    First, mhshow will look for an entry of the form:

      mhshow-show-<type>/<subtype>

    to determine the command to use to display the content. If this
    isn't found, mhshow will look for an entry of the form:

      mhshow-show-<type>

    to determine the display command. If this isn't found, mhshow has
    two default values:

      mhshow-show-text/plain: %pmoreproc '%F'
      mhshow-show-message/rfc822: %pshow -file '%F'

    If neither apply, mhshow will check to see if the message has a
    application/octet-stream content with parameter "type=tar". If so,
    mhshow will use an appropriate command. If not, mhshow will
    complain.

  So, add defaults that cover the types MH doesn't handle right now
  (or doesn't handle the way you want it to). Your defaults will
  override corresponding defaults in the $MHLIB/mhn.defaults
  (mhn_defaults) file. For example, if you don't have an HTML
  editor/browser on your system, you could tell MH to use the "less"
  paginator for HTML message parts:

    mhshow-show-text/x-html: less %F

  You can put that line in your MH profile.

  You can even set different defaults for different terminal types
  (say, your VT100 at home and your X setup at work). Make a file in
  the same format as mhn.defaults (mhn_defaults); store its pathname
  in the MHSHOW (MHN) environment variable. Add a test to your shell
  setup file (.bash_profile, .profile, .login) that tests the value of
  the TERM variable -- and, if you have an mhshow (mhn) setup file for
  that terminal type, store its pathname in the MHSHOW (MHN) variable.

  MH 6.8.3 has a bug where it will not handle multipart/foo correctly
  if it doesn't know about foo. The patch:

    http://www.gw.com/mail/mh/patches/all/mhn_multipart
 
  tells it to treat such things as if they were multipart/mixed.

  On System V system, add this to your crontab. If you don't have one,
  put this in a file, and run "crontab file". If your system does not
  support personal crontab files, get your system administrator to add
  an equivalent line to the system crontab file or daily clean-up

From: Patrick.Wambacq at esat.kuleuven.ac.be

  One should put the following lines in the $MHLIB/mts.conf
  (mtstailor) file:

    lockldir:
    lockstyle: 1

  This prevents MH from using kernel level locking, and uses lock
  files instead. It solved the problem for me on two different
  architectures. When the lockldir entry is left empty as above, the
  lock file is put in the same directory as the file to be locked. If
  another directory is wanted, its name should be put here.

From: alhy at MAILBOX.SLAC.Stanford.EDU
Date: Mon, 9 Sep 1996 01:01:16 -0700

  Often, this is caused by an NFS file lock. Don't ask me how it got
  there in the first place. To remove the file lock, do the following:

    # cd /var/spool/mail
    # cp user /tmp/user.tmp; rm user	# save mail; remove locked file
    # chown user /tmp/user.tmp		# allow user to inc old mail
    # su - user
    user% inc -file user.tmp		# incorporate user's old mail

  Any mail that you receive in the fraction of a second that the
  second set of commands takes will be lost.

    SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.
    It includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP
    protocols, and all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no
    JavaScript required) for maximum compatibility across browsers. It
    has very few requirements and is very easy to configure and

Subject: 03.11 How can I run inc automatically with POP?
From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Mon, 27 Nov 1995 12:23:51 -0800

  If MH has been compiled with RPOP, then the POP server host either
  needs to have your host in /etc/hosts.equiv or in your .rhosts file.
  Then add to your MH profile:

    inc: -host cuckoo

  given that "cuckoo" is the name of the your POP server.

From: Andy Norman <ange at hplb.hpl.hp.com>
Date: Mon, 1 May 1995 00:00:00 -0800

  Assuming your POP server is called cuckoo, add an entry to your MH
  profile for 'inc' like so:

    inc: -noaudit -norpop -noapop -host cuckoo

  Add the following to ~/.netrc and ensure it [grants no permissions to
  group or other] (e.g., chmod 600 .netrc):

    machine cuckoo.domain.name login joeuser password secret

  Replace the hostname, login and password with your own, of course.
  The hostname probably has to be fully qualified (i.e., include the
  full domain name). This example assumes that you can send mail by
  other means (e.g., with SMTP).

  If you get the error:

    inc: -ERR Unknown command: "rpop"

  you're trying to use "rpop" as the mechanism to authenticate the
  user. This mechanism is specified in RFC 1225 and then removed by
  RFC 1460.

  Your POP server is (rightly) rejecting this.

  The POP specification (RFC 1939) states that authentication is done
  either via a USER/PASS pair or via the APOP command.

  Try running inc with -noapop -norpop flags.

  I personally think [the solution below] is not the right solution.
  There's a reason that new window is opened--to ensure the correct

From: Mayank Choudhary <micky at eng.sun.com>

  MH considers "From " lines as message separators, so if this string

From: Bill Wohler <wohler at gbr.newt.com>

  You might find that you have two versions of the same message within
  the message. For example, one part might have a content type of
  text/plain and the other might be text/html.

  You may find that mhshow (mhn -show) wants to show the HTML version
  This is a feature of the multipart/alternative content type. If you
  prefer reading the the plain text version over the HTML version,
  you'd have to remove the line in $MHLIB/mhn.defaults or
  ~/.mh_profile that starts with mhshow-show-text/html
  (mhn-show-text/html). Of course, the tradeoff is that you'd never be
  able to view text/html at all, but you probably wouldn't care.

  The % escapes are described in the mhshow (mhn) man page. The ",
  new-window" argument in the netscape invocation is optional, but
  handy. After reading the message, you can dismiss the window with
  M-w and go back to reading mail.

From: Joel Reicher <joel at panacea.null.org>
Date: 31 Oct 2001 00:36:14 +1100

  I haven't quite managed a recursive listing, but I have worked out a
  recursive store, which is still useful. Hinted by a builtin display
  string for mhshow, I found the following works for mhstore:

    mhstore-store-message/rfc822: | mhstore -file -

  With that, mhstore will happily recurse down storing everything on
  its way. Not very discriminate, but the line can be altered to limit
  without destroying the recursion:

    mhstore-store-message/rfc822: | mhstore -auto -type message/rfc822 -type image/jpeg -file -

  which also names the files automatically for good measure.

  And, FWIW, I engage this by putting it in a separate file and
  invoking mhstore like

    env MHSTORE=mhn.rec mhstore

From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  To convert your MH folders to BABYL folders, first run the following
  script on your Mail directory.

    #!/bin/sh

    for f in Mail/*; do
	if [ -d $f ]; then
	    touch msgbox
	    folder=`basename $f`
	    echo -n packing $folder ...
	    packf +$folder
	    echo done
	    mv msgbox Mail-rmail/$folder
	fi
    done

  This assumes you don't have nested folders. Your rmail folders will
  be left in $HOME/Mail-rmail in MMDF format which rmail can read.
  Then run rmail-input for each folder, which converts each folder
  into BABYL format.

  Be sure not to append any messages before they are converted from
  MMDF to BABYL, since there may be really strange results.

Subject: 04.03 Why do I get ".../.mh_sequences is poorly formatted?"
From: Richard Coleman <coleman at math.gatech.edu>
Date: Tue, 20 Jan 1998 02:19:58 -0500

  This bug has been fixed in nmh (as of version 0.20). There are no
  limitations on the length of an entry in the .mh_sequences file.

From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: Mon, 1 Aug 1994 00:00:00 -0800

  There is a line length limit in this file. When sequences are
  unbroken (without gaps in numbering), that makes short entries in
  the .mh_sequences file, like this:

    inftex: 72-8000

  But when there are lots of numbering gaps, the entry gets long:

    inftex: 76 79-81 87 95-96 105 109 120 124 135 141 158 163...

  That's when you run into problems, and why it's good to keep the
  folder packed when you can. Simply run "folder -pack +folder".

  If you're refiling a lot of messages in a large folder, you might
  not be able to use sequences. Use backquotes to give the message
  numbers directly to "refile". For example:

    refile +tex/info-tex `pick -to info-tex`

  That can still generate a long list of arguments to the "refile"
  command, and some Unixes can't handle that. In that case, use
  xargs(1):

    pick -to info-tex | xargs refile +tex/info-tex

  If worse comes to worst, fire up a Bourne shell and use a "while"
  loop:

    pick -to info-tex | fmt | while read nums; do
	refile +tex/info-tex $nums
    done

  The fmt(1) command breaks long lines into manageable chunks of 72
  characters or so, splitting arguments at whitespace. When you
  redirect the input of a while loop, a "read" command will read the
  incoming text and store it in a shell variable line by line. This is
  a quick-&-dirty way to write xargs(1) if you don't have it.

From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>

  If your newsreader handles backquotes on its command line, you can
  use the mhpath command. For instance, if your "save" command is "s":

    s `mhpath new +somefolder`

  Or if your newsreader lets you define your own commands, as in shell
  aliases, you could define that as a command.

  If your newsreader can pipe an article to the standard input of a
  program, use the "rcvstore" command (in the MH library). For
  instance, if your "pipe" command is "|":

    | $MHLIB/rcvstore +somefolder

  Of course, you can also put that in a little shell script.

  The easiest way I know of is to sort the folder by the Message-ID

  After the sort, each message should be next to its duplicates in the
  folder. Use a script (shell, Perl, etc.) to weed out the duplicates.
  (See "Removing duplicate messages (Bourne)").

Date: Fri, 1 Jan 1993 00:00:00 -0800

  When making a reply, specify a filter file on the command line:

    repl -filter repl.format

  This filter file must be in your MH mail directory (usually "Mail",
  in your home directory). Here are a couple of example repl.format
  files:

    overflowtext="",overflowoffset=0
    message-id:nocomponent,formatfield=\
    "In message %{text}, you wrote:"
    body:component="> ",overflowtext="> ",overflowoffset=0

  or

    overflowtext="",overflowoffset=0
    date:component="Your message dated",formatfield=\
    "%<(nodate{text})%{text}%|%(pretty{text})%>"
    body:component="> ",overflowtext="> ",overflowoffset=0

  Setting overflowoffset to 0 keeps MH from doing anything to
  extra-long lines in the headers. In the body, however, this behavior
  is overridden so that long lines are automatically broken and a ">"
  is inserted before every line. You could put almost whatever you
  want between those quotes, although the "standard" ">" makes it
  easier to read notes that have been included several times. The
  examples differ with the descriptive text that is inserted before
  the included body.

  It is suggested not to use the "prompter" editor in this case, since
  it is likely that you'll not want to use all of the included
  message. Indeed, it is proper etiquette to edit out all unnecessary
  include verbiage so readers don't have to wade through the morass to
  read your pearls of wisdom.

     To use the replfmt file, add the following to your ~/.mh_profile:

       repl: -filter replfmt

     When comp is used, your signature is already there along with my
     headers. When repl is used, the mhl program takes the body of
     the letter you're replying to, prepends '> ' to each line and
     then adds your signature at the end (available after version
     6.7).

  1b) Create an "editor" which can be called from whatnow to add the
      signature when desired or create a frontend to post (use the
      .mh_profile line "postproc: postproc" to call it) that always
      appends the .signature file before calling post to mail the
      message. David J. Fiander <david at golem.uucp>, David A.
      Truesdell <truesdel at nas.nasa.gov> and Tom Wilmore <sastjw at
      unx.sas.com> have sample scripts to do these.

  1c) mysend, a sendproc script, processes a message after "What now?
      send". See "What references exist for MH" to see where the MH
      book scripts can be ftped from. The script is explained in MH
      book Section 7.1.4 (13.13), or the URL:
      http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/mh/senove.html#ASAtDm

  2) Using your editor.  If you use vi, you can use something like:

       map S :r ~/.signature

     to load your signature out of .signature every time you
     hit 'S'.

  3) Use your windowing system. xterm, for example, can provide key
     and button mappings for the utterly lazy.

  4) If you use Emacs with MH-E:

  4a) C-c C-s will append the signature.

From: Andre Srinivasan <andre at neuronet.pitt.edu>
Date: Mon, 1 May 1995 00:00:00 -0800

  4b) Add the following to your .emacs file:

	(add-hook 'mh-compose-letter-function
	    (function
	     (lambda(a b c)
	       (save-excursion
		 (goto-char (point-max))
		 (beginning-of-line)
		 (mh-insert-signature)))))

      This hook is called after the draft buffer has been initialized,
      but before you have a chance to type anything.

Date: Tue, 1 Nov 1994 00:00:00 -0800

  Tired of the same old signature? Want different signatures for
  different newsgroups? Here's a program to help you out.

  The way it works is to have .signature be a named pipe, so if you
  don't have named pipes, just say 'n'.

  The sigrand program then feeds stuff down the pipe every time
  someone wants to read it. That way it works for more than just news,
  but for anything that wants to read your .signature, like a mailer.

  You have your choice of three kinds of signatures:

      1) random (short) fortune from "fortune -s"; you get these if
	 you don't have a global sig file.
      2) random fortune from ~/News/SIGNATURES [global sig file]
      3) random fortune form ~/News/(newsgroup)/SIGNATURES [local sig files]

  Send mail if interested.

  How about:

    forw [-digest tmp] [-form forwcomps] [-filter mhl.digest]

  These messages can be un-digestified :-) by the MH burst(1) program.

  See also MH book sections 7.9.7 (6.8.7), 8.10 (7.9), or the URLs:

  There's another way, which is better if the recipient understands
  MIME.

    forw -mime messages +folder

  (Make sure that you either have "automhnproc: mhn" in your mh
  profile, or type "edit mhn" to whatnow before you send it.)

  This bundles each message in a MIME message/rfc822 part, and then
  bundles the whole mess up in a multipart/digest part. You can still
  add your own text at the beginning. The MH burst program can also
  understand these messages and split them apart with no problem. This
  works beautifully with MIME-capable mail readers, especially exmh.

  If you find that your mailer creates a From header that others have
  trouble replying to, you can add a Reply-To header to override the
  From header in replies.

  Copy the components and replcomps files which are normally found in
  $MHLIB into your Mail directory and add a line like the following
  after the Subject header replacing my address with your address:

From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>

  With either of the following solutions, you'll need to add an
  Alternate-Mailboxes entry in your MH profile so that scan prints
  "To: recipient" rather than your faked address. For example, if your
  real address is user@somedomain.com and you've added a From field
  of:

    From: Joe Bob <joe.bob@somedomain.com>

  you'll add the following to .mh_profile:

    Alternate-Mailboxes: joe.bob@somedomain.com

Date: Mon, 18 Dec 1995 17:51:33 -0800

  I suggest the use of the Dcc: field (See "What is the Dcc header?"),
  since the use of "Dcc:" solves the issue of having the same
  Message-Id. The warning about using Dcc: in general contexts doesn't
  apply to self-blind-carbon copies, and if "Dcc:" is used and you are
  automatically sorting messages into folders based on mailing lists,
  messages which you send will get refiled in the same way. Some may
  prefer all outgoing messages to be segregated; others (including
  myself) prefer not to segregate outgoing messages.

  Copy the components and replcomps files which are normally found in
  $MHLIB into your Mail directory and add a line like the following
  after the cc header:

    Fcc: +out

  All outgoing messages will then be saved in the +out folder. If you
  make a distcomps file, it needs "Resent-Fcc:".

From: Jeppe Sigbrandt <jay at elec.gla.ac.uk>
Date: Sat, 5 Apr 1997 02:04:53 +0100

  You can also use @ in the Fcc field to file the outgoing message in
  the current folder.

    Fcc: @

  This is useful if you filter your mail (e.g., with procmail) and you
  read your mail in folders other than +inbox.

From: David S. Goldberg <dsg at linus.mitre.org>
Date: 30 Oct 1995 10:23:55 -0500

  You can get the Message-ID field by placing the folder in the "Fcc"
  field and adding:

    send: -msgid

  to your .mh_profile. Unfortunately, this Message-ID isn't as useful
  as sendmail's--it doesn't include the date.

  My suggestion would be to run Tom Christiansen's rfi script. If you

  One good idea would be to write a whatnowproc that files the mail

From: Brian Exelbierd <bex at ncsu.edu>
Date: Mon, 09 Oct 1995 08:05:55 -0400

  The short guide:

  1. Compose a letter using comp.

  2. When you get to a point where you want to include a MIME
     attachment, type the following to include a GIF image (note: the
     '#' must be in the first column):

	#image/gif [Pictures at an Exhibition] /usr/lib/pictures/exhibition.gif

  3. Finish your letter, adding more text or attachments as needed.

  4. Save your letter and exit the editor. At the Whatnow prompt type
     "edit mhn". mhn will automatically format your letter with the
     MIME attachments leaving the original letter in ,##,orig where ##
     is the letter number.

  5. Type "send" at the Whatnow prompt, and poof, you have just sent
     MIME mail. I strongly recommend you practice sending yourself
     MIME mail first.

  For more information, see the mhn(1) man page,

Subject: 05.13 What's the best way to send mail to a long list of people?
From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 1995 07:53:53 -0700

  There are three ways to keep the list of members from appearing in
  everyone's header.

  If you're planning on mailing to these people regularly, the best
  way is to create an alias in /etc/aliases (/usr/lib/aliases). That
  way, recipients can send and reply to the list as well.

  The other two ways allow you to manage the list privately, but the
  recipients cannot send to the list (unless you set something up with
  your deliver or procmail script). One is with a group list. It looks
  like this:

    To: All-members: member1, member2, member3, ..., membern;

  The recipients see this:

    To: All-members:;

  You can make this an MH alias as well.

  The second way is to use a blind carbon copy (see "How do I send
  blind carbon copies?").

  Or you could also use the undocumented Dcc field which is used like
  the Bcc field, but doesn't inject the "Blind-Carbon-Copy." Warning:
  (See "What is the Dcc header?")

------------------------------
  
Subject: 05.14 What is the Dcc header?
From: jpeek at jpeek.com (Jerry Peek)
Date: 14 Sep 96 05:51:13 GMT

  If you put the alias in the Dcc field and leave the To: field empty,
  there's a good chance that the recipients will get a message with
  the header field:

    Apparently-to: <someaddress>

  and it might even list several addresses. To avoid that, use a To:
  field with some address (like yours) in it. I use a comment that
  tells people what's really happening--like this, more or less:

    To: "Faculty members, c/o" <super@wierdlmpc.msci.memphis.edu> 
    dcc: faculty

  There are some other choices, like using an un-replyable group list
  in the To: field, but I think they tend to confuse non-techies.

Date: Wed, 27 Sep 1995 09:46:37 -0700
From: John Romine <jromine at yoyodyne.ICS.UCI.EDU>

  The Dcc (Distribution Carbon Copy) field behaves much like the Bcc
  field, but does not add the "Blind-Carbon-Copy" notice. This header
  is removed before posting the message,and a copy of the message is
  distributed to each listed address. This could be considered a form
  of Blind Carbon Copy which is best used for sending to an address
  which would never reply (such as an auto-archiver).

  People should not be using Dcc as a substitute-Bcc to send to other
  people. When users use Dcc as a substitute for Bcc, there is *no*
  indication to the "blind" recipients that they have received a blind
  copy. If those recipients should reply (and they have no indication
  why they shouldn't), the original author could be very embarassed
  (or worse).

  Section 11.2 of the MH book, or the URL:

    http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/mh/mhstr.html

  These will explain the default replcomps file, included here. Don't

    --------

  In particular, note the following:

    \   consider the following line to be part of the current line. If
	this continuation character is absent, a newline (\n) will
	always be inserted. Note that if the field is conditional, and
	the condition is false, and there isn't a trailing backslash,
	then a blank line will appear in your reply. Since the rest of
	the header will now be considered to be part of the body, this
	is probably not what you want.
    \n  inject an actual newline into the reply. Note that inserting a
	field without a trailing backslash (\) will cause that field
	to be emitted in the reply as well.
    %<{field}, %?{field}, %|, %>
        if field exists, else if field exists, else, endif.
	Conditional fields nearly always contain an explicit newline
	(\n) and end with a continuation character (\).
    %(command)	mh-format commands
    %{field}	value of the header field inserted at this point

  To add new fields, you can either add fields based on whether
  certain fields exist in the original message (e.g.,
  %<{message-id}...), or hard-code them, as in the Fcc, Subject, or
  Comments fields above.

Subject: 05.16 How can I convert quoted-printable to 8bit in quoted text in replies?
From: Jarle F. Greipsland <jarle at idt.unit.no>
Date: 22 Aug 1995 10:42:07 +0200

  The idea behind the solution is that I need mhn to store the
  contents of the mail in the native iso8859-1 format somewhere. I did
  this by creating a custom editor that is invoked when I reply to a
  message. This editor extracts the body of the message (sorry, no
  multipart stuff), indents it with '> ', appends it to the draft
  message and invokes the ordinary editor on it. Here are the details:

  `isorepl' is a symbolic link from my $HOME/bin-directory to `repl'.

  In my .mh_profile I added the following two lines:

    isorepl: -form isoreplcomps -editor isoextract
    isoextract-next: vi

  The isoreplcomps file in my Mail-directory contains:

    %(lit)%(formataddr %<{reply-to}%?{from}%?{sender}%?{return-path}%>)\
    %<(nonnull)%(void(width))%(putaddr To: )\n%>\
    %(lit)%(formataddr{to})%(formataddr{cc})%(formataddr(me))\
    %<(nonnull)%(void(width))%(putaddr cc: )\n%>\
    %<{fcc}Fcc: %{fcc}\n%>\
    %<{subject}Subject: Re: %{subject}\n%>\
    %<{date}In-reply-to: Your message of "\
    %<(nodate{date})%{date}%|%(pretty{date})%>."%<{message-id}
		 %{message-id}%>\n%>\
    --------
    #<text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
    %<{message-id}In message %{message-id} %>\
    %<{from}%(friendly{from}) writes%|You write%>:

  This is a "Usenet-like" quoting style. Modify to suit your own
  taste. This form will setup the proper header, as well as the first
  line of the new message (In <mmmmbbbb> nnnn writes etc.).

  The first editor, `isoextract', looks like this:

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    # Called from within repl where the "editalt" variable is valid
    #
    # Point to a special MHN configuration file (save old one)
    OLDMHN="$MHN"
    MHN=$HOME/`mhparam Path`/isoquotemsg
    export MHN

    # Extract message body to "native" format (should be iso-8859-1)
    # > More bla bla.
    mhn -file "$editalt" -store >> $1 2>/dev/null

    MHN="$OLDMHN"
    myname=`basename $0`
    next=`mhparam ${myname}-next`
    if [ "x$next" != "x" ]; then
	    exec $next "$@"
    fi

  `isoquotemsg' has just one rule; how mhn should store a text message.

    mhn-store-text: |sed -e 's/^[	]*$//' \
			 -e 's/^\([>|]\)\(.*\)$/>\1\2/' \
			 -e 's/^\([^>|].*\)$/> \1/'

  This tells mhn to pipe the message to stdout, where the sed commands
  will do the reformatting/quoting. (Note: the first pair of square
  brackets contains a space and a tab.)

  So, when I do a `isorepl' to a message, `repl' will create the draft
  message with the proper headers (based on the `isoreplcomps' format
  file), fire off its first editor, `isoextract', with the name of the
  draft file as its parameter. `isoextract' then invokes mhn in a
  suitable environment, tells it that it is to use the file $editalt
  as its source, and orders it to store the contents. The store-text
  rule in the custom MHN-file tells it to just pipe the message (in
  native iso8859-1 form) through a small set of sed commands, and
  `isoextract' uses the normal shell construct to append the result to
  the draft file. Then, if there's defined a `isoextract-next' entry
  in the .mh_profile, isoextract exec's this editor.

Subject: 05.17 Can I have aliases include aliases?
From: Bruce Cox <bruce at maths.su.oz.au>
Date: Fri, 16 Aug 1996 14:26:12 +1000

  Indeed, you can.

  You just need to remember the way MH expands aliases. In particular,
  the right hand sides are only expanded by the aliases below them in
  your aliases file. So, if you put in:

    dead-men: presidents, authors
    presidents: washington, lincoln, jefferson, roosevelt
    authors: thoreau, irving, london

  and type:

    ali dead-men

  then you would get the response:

    washington, lincoln, jefferson, roosevelt, thoreau, irving, london

  If you had the dead-men line after the presidents and authors
  aliases, the response would be:

    presidents, authors

From: "John L. Romine" <jromine at yoyodyne.ics.uci.edu>

  One way that mhmail might be run is from a shell script. This means
  that the user running it might not use MH, and would not have a
  .mh_profile, etc. If you want to use aliases with mhmail, expand
  them before passing them as arguments (e.g., "mhmail `ali joe`").

From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Thu, 9 Mar 2006 21:42:21 -0800

  In the past, the In-reply-to header field looked as it does in the
  new Comments field (see "How can I make sense of the replcomps
  file?"). However, the old format is no longer allowable under RFC
  2822 which specifies that this field should only include the
  Message-ID. You can fix the replcomps and replgroupcomps files by
  upgrading to nmh 1.1 (be sure to update your personal copies if
  applicable) or simply by fixing the In-reply-to field in your own
  replcomps file using the example in the question referenced in this
  paragraph.

  In addition, older replcomps files lacked the References field which
  enables threading in capable UIs. You can get it in the same fashion
  as the In-reply-to field--by upgrading or copying.

Subject: 06.01 What to do with "Problems with edit - draft removed".
From: John Romine <jromine at ics.uci.edu>
Date: Mon, 1 May 1995 00:00:00 -0800

  If your users are using an AT&T version of "vi", it's exiting with
  non-zero status (supposedly a count of the "errors" during the
  edit). Move "vi" to "broken_vi" and put it its place :

    #! /bin/sh
    /usr/ucb/broken_vi "$@"
    exit 0

  Alternatively, compile MH with the ATTVIBUG option.

  Then complain to your vendor that "vi" is broken, and they shouldfix it.

Subject: 06.02 Can I run my message through a program (e.g., ispell) before sending?
From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  It's pretty simple. If your speller is called myspell, use:

    What now? edit myspell

  MH will actually execute:

    myspell /your-mail-draft-directory/draftfile

  and give the entire draft message to your speller. The header will
  probably be "misspelled," of course, though you might be able to
  tell the speller to ignore it--or you could hack up a little shell
  script to run the speller on just the message body, then tack the
  corrected body back onto the header before sending.

  You can automate this some more. For example, if you want your
  speller to run after your first edit with "prompter" and also after
  you leave the "vi" editor, add these lines to your MH profile:

      prompter-next: myspell
      vi-next: myspell

  Then, at the "What now?" prompt:

      What now? e

  your speller will run. For more info, see the mh-profile(5) man page
  or section 7.2.1 (6.2.1) of the MH book, or the URL:

  You may find that post returns the following message:

  The unquoted dot causes "Mr. Foo" to be parsed as the local part of

Date: Tue, 1 Nov 1994 00:00:00 -0800

  The error message itself is essentially correct. However, what this
  really means is: MH's post cannot connect to a running sendmail over
  an SMTP port (MH configured with SMTP and SENDMTS).

  The potential problems:

  1. Your local sendmail daemon is dying or not running for some
     reason.

  2. You use BIND and your local nameserver is not responding.
     Solution: Delete "/etc/resolv.conf."

  3. Your $MHLIB/mts.conf (mtstailor) has its "servers:" pointing to a
     non-existent machine or a machine which is a) not reachable or b)
     not running the sendmail daemon.

  5. Your load average is so high that sendmail is refusing

     Solution: Change your configuration from "mts: smtp" to "mts:
     sendmail" (after nmh 1.5, "mts: sendmail/smtp" or "mts:
     sendmail/pipe") so that a sendmail processes is spawned to

From: Paul Pomes <ppomes at Qualcomm.com>

  The problem in sendmail is that the RSET after the ONEX does not
  reset all the state information.  Normally sendmail fork()s after
  the Mail from: statement and a RSET causes that child to exit. This
  automatically cleans up.  If the fork() is suppressed by ONEX, then
  the source must be modified to do the cleanup.  See "srvrsmtp.c
  patch" in the Appendix.  If you don't have the sources, modify your
  MH sources to not use the ONEX verb.

  This problem happens when there is no interface defined within the
  tcp system.  A couple of workarounds include:

  o Use a hostname (other than the local host) instead of localhost in
    the "servers" entry of the $MHLIB/mts.conf (mtstailor) file.
  o Recompile MH with sendmail instead of sendmail/smtp (not very
    elegant).

  A better fix would be to define your tcp interface.

  Here, you run ifconfig and route (as root) to define the loopback
  device and route. You should add them to rc.local so they are
  effected at every boot.

    # ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1			# Linux
    # ifconfig lo0 127.0.0.1		# Sun

    # route 127.0.0.1

  If all is well, "ifconfig lo" (or lo0), will show something like
  this (on my Linux system):

    lo        Link encap Local Loopback
	      inet addr 127.0.0.1  Bcast 127.255.255.255  Mask 255.0.0.0
	      UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU 2000  Metric 0
	      RX packets 0 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
	      TX packets 519 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0

  and "netstat -r" will show:

    # netstat -r
    Destination net/address   Gateway address    Flags RefCnt    Use Iface
    127.0.0.0                 *                  UN         0    519 lo

  If you're not on a network and running DNS, your /etc/hosts will
  need at least:

    127.0.0.1	your_host_name localhost 	# loopback address

  Note: put your name FIRST on the localhost line. This official name
  is used by sendmail to determine your return address.

  If you are on a network and running DNS, you might find that putting
  your host name in the localhost entry might gum up other things, in
  which case you'll want your hostname to have its own proper address.

  This might not do it though. David Youatt <dpy at sgi.com> says that
  his network was happy but he still had the problem until he upgraded
  his system and got the latest revision of sendmail as well. He says:
  "Turns out that that the problem I was having seems to be caused (at
  least partly, maybe entirely) by the version of sendmail that is
  shipped with IRIX 5.2 (sendmail 5.65, I think). The version shipped
  w/IRIX 5.3 (in beta) is sendmail 8.6.9 and works fine."

  I'm not entirely happy with this section, so please give me some
  feedback. If you have this problem, please send me <wohler at
  newt.com> a brief description so I'll know which problems and
  solutions seem to be the most prevalent.

  To use a different SMTP server temporarily (after nmh 1.5):

    What now? send -server smtp.example.com

  Use the name or address of your SMTP server, of course.
  Alternatively, if you can use your local sendmail program, then
  enable that by one of these methods:

  1. Change the mts setting in your mts.conf to:

       mts: sendmail/pipe

  2. Add the mts setting to a send entry in your profile. For example,

       send: -mts sendmail/pipe

  3. Override the mts setting temporarily:

       What now? send -mts sendmail/pipe

  4. Add the following to your profile:

       postproc: $MHLIB/spost

     This is the only available solution if you are running a version
     of MH other than nmh 1.5 and higher. However, the use of spost is
     discouraged because:

     a) It requires the local sendmail to be configured for delivery
     to all possible addresses. This may not be as common as it used
     to be, as it is limited by many ISPs.

     b) spost and blind MH aliases turn out to be a potentially
     dangerous combination: spost expands them as if they weren't
     blind, so all recipients see them.

  If you are sharing your $MHLIB/mts.conf (mtstailor) file among

  use 'localhost' as the hostname argument to the clientname parameter

  You can solve this by putting

  HELO command.

  Easy possibilities are: apply the patch to MH that comes with

Subject: 07.01 What mail filters are available?
From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Sun, 11 Mar 2001 10:27:24 -0800

  The list currently includes slocal (included with MH), deliver,
  procmail and mailagent. They are briefly described here. Slocal is
  probably the most popular by virtue of being included in the
  distribution. The next most popular entry is procmail, followed by
  deliver.

  Slocal comes with MH. It can be used to process incoming mail based
  on the contents of any of the headers. Actions include filing
  messages, running commands, printing messages on your terminal and
  so on. The configuration is made in ~/.maildelivery. People seem to
  have trouble with slocal bugs, and you can't use it if you don't
  have write permission on your system maildrop so a lot of people
  have opted for the alternatives, but it's easy to use and comes with
  MH.

  procmail is quite popular and has a very powerful configuration
  file. However, the syntax is its own, but it is easy to learn given
  a couple of good examples. Its advantages are its small size and
  speed. Like deliver, procmail may be installed as a delivery agent
  so you would not even have to have a .forward file.

  Deliver can run any script or program (called ~/.deliver), so you
  really can do anything you want to incoming mail. One feature that
  it sports that no other does is that you can install it as a local
  mailer in place of /bin/mail. If it's the local mailer, you don't
  need to have a .forward--~/.deliver is run anyway. In addition, it
  allows the system administrator to write some programs to filter
  everybody's mail. It came with my Linux system, so installation was
  non-existent.

  I started with slocal, and then moved to deliver. I switched to
  procmail because of a bug in deliver (which I think has since been
  fixed) whereby a blank line would be inserted into the header before
  header fields with numbers in them.

  I am still using procmail and probably will do so indefinitely since
  it is powerful, there are many spam filters written in it, and it
  coexists with MH and Gnus so well.

  My recommendation is to use the one that is installed on your system
  or get procmail. Here are the URLs for the filters mentioned in this
  document:

  Procmail can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort
  your incoming mail into separate folders/files (real convenient when
  subscribing to one or more mailing lists or for prioritizing your
  mail), preprocess your mail, start any programs upon mail arrival
  (e.g. to generate different chimes on your workstation for different
  types of mail) or selectively forward certain incoming mail
  automatically to someone.

  "mailagent" is yet another mail filter, written in perl, which will
  let you do anything with your mail. It has all the features you may
  expect from a filter: mailing lists sorting, forwarding to MTA or to
  inews, pre-processing of message before saving into folder, vacation
  mode, etc. It was initially written as an Elm-filter replacement,
  but has now enough power to also supplant MMDF's .maildelivery.
  There is also a support for @SH mail hooks, which allows you to
  automatically distribute patches or software via command mails.

  The mailagent was designed to make mail filtering as easy as it can
  be. It is highly configurable and fairly complete. Rules are
  specified in a lex-like style, with the full power of perl's regular
  expressions. The automaton supports the notion of mode, and header
  selection has many magic features built-in, to ease the rule writing
  process.

  The distribution comes with a set of examples, an exhaustive test
  suite, and naturally a detailed manual page. It should be noted that
  the mailagent will work even if your system administrator forbids "|
  programs" hooks in the ~/.forward, provided you have access to some
  sort of cron daemon.

From: Bill Wohler <wohler at newt.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  See the slocal man page.

  Here is brief example of a .maildelivery file that stores messages
  to babble in a folder and the system mailbox, stores mh-users in a
  folder but not the system mailbox, and puts the rest in the system
  mailbox.

    to  mh-users  | A "$MHLIB/rcvstore -create +lists/mh-users"
    cc  mh-users  | A "$MHLIB/rcvstore -create +lists/mh-users"
    to  babble    | R "$MHLIB/rcvstore -create +lists/babble"
    cc  babble    | R "$MHLIB/rcvstore -create +lists/babble"
    default -     > ? /usr/spool/mail/wohler

  Your .forward file may look like (quotes necessary):

    "| $MHLIB/slocal -user your_login"

  In some implementations, the "-user your_login" is not needed. If
  not, manually running slocal with the flag will produce an error.

  See also chapter 12 (11) in the MH book, or the URL:

    http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/mh/tocs/prmaau.html

  Alternatives to slocal include deliver, procmail, and mailagent.

  Use as many of the following as necessary.

  Put a message into a file and call slocal directly on it.

    $MHLIB/slocal -user $USER -verbose -debug < test-msg

  Modify your .forward to look like:

    "|/bin/sh -c 'exec >> /tmp/out 2>&1;
    $MHLIB/slocal -user $USER -verbose -debug'"

  Or modify a rule in .maildelivery to look like this:

    to foo | R "set -xv; exec >/tmp/out 2>&1; $MHLIB/rcvstore +foo"

  The previous examples are broken up for readability; the text must
  appear on one line.

  I've been been using a program called xlbiff (X Literate Biff) and

  pop-up listings by running scan on your mail drop file, but it's not
  a big deal to customize xlbiff for more complicated setups if you
  make heavy use of procmail, multiple mail drops, and so on.

  nmh (new MH) has an additional command (flist) that will tell you
  which folders have unseen messages. I can't imagine using MH without
  it.

From: crow at tivoli.com (David L. Crow)
Date: 7 Jul 97 09:36:32 GMT

  I have used the following X resource with xbiff before:

    xbiff*checkCommand: grep -q '^unread' `mhpath +inbox`/.mh_sequences \
                        && exit 0 || exit 2

  This should be all one line, but I split it with a line continuation
  character for readability.

  If you use MH-E, use "F n (mh-index-new-messages)" to display unseen
  messages.

From: Neil W Rickert <rickert+nn at cs.niu.edu>
Date: 23 Apr 2002 20:38:57 GMT

  Here is my "unseen" shell script:

  #! /bin/sh -

  case "$1" in
   "") grep unseen $HOME/Mail/context $HOME/Mail/*/.mh_sequences |
	  sed     -e '/\/fromme\//d' \
		  -e "s=$HOME/Mail/==" \

  I have procmail deliver to a set of mbox files and use "inc -f foo"
  to inc from them. The names of the mbox files are the same as the MH
  folders which makes it easy to write a script that does something
  like this:

      cd Mailboxes
      for x in *; do
	  inc -f $x +$x
      done

Subject: 09.01 How can I get xmh to use Emacs as the editor?
From: Bob Ellison <ellison at sei.cmu.edu>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  The modifications to xmh to support an external editor, annotations,
  and an append command can be found in the these places.

    ftp://ftp.x.org/R5contrib/xmh-mods-R5-1.7.Z				37k
    ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/xmh/xmh-mods-R5-1.7.Z			37k
    ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/xmh/xmh-mods-R6-1.0.Z			37k

From: Andrew Wason <aw at bae.bellcore.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  As of R5, xmh has a new action proc called XmhShellCommand. A string
  parameter will be executed as a shell command with the currently
  selected messages as parameters (or the current message if there are
  no selected messages).

  Using this new action, a couple of shell scripts, a window version
  of emacs (e.g. xemacs) and some elisp code, xmh can use emacs as its
  editor instead of the built in Athena text widget editor. This
  doesn't require any source code changes to xmh. These are included
  in the Appendix "Switching xmh's editor".

------------------------------
  
Subject: 09.02 Does xmh support subfolders?
From: Steve Malowany <malowany at cenparmi.concordia.ca>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  Yes. Create one by invoking "Create Folder" as usual, and enter
  something like: existing-folder/new-sub-folder. You can then access
  the subfolder by popping up a menu over the "existing-folder" button
  item.

  But:

From: John Cooper <jsc at saxon.Eng.Sun.COM>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  The R5 version of xmh does *not* handle nested sub-folders. If you
  create a folder as 'grab/some/bandwidth', xmh displays this folder
  name for the remainder of the session where it was created, BUT if
  you later re-run xmh, the folder is no longer visible to xmh.

  See also MH book section 15.6.2 (15.6.2), or the URL:

    http://rand-mh.sourceforge.net/book/xmh/orgfol.html#FolaSub

Subject: 09.03 How do I precede included messages with ">" when replying in xmh?
From: Len Makin <len at mel.dit.csiro.au>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  Include the following line in your ~/app-defaults/XMh file:

    Xmh*replyInsertFilter: "sed 's/^/> /'"

  or,

    Xmh.ReplyInsertFilter: $MHLIB/mhl -form repl.filter

From: Andy Linton <andy.linton at comp.vuw.ac.nz>
Date: Fri, 1 Mar 1991 13:03:15 -0800

  Using this means that you can chose to insert the original by use of
  the "Insert" button in the Draft message pane. See "How do I include
  messages in repl with or without ">"?" to find examples of
  repl.filter.

Xan xemacs window will come up with your draft message.
X
XOnce you have written your mail, save it and exit GNU emacs (C-xC-c).
XYou will be prompted if you want to send the current message.
XIf you enter 'y', the message will be sent and the output will
Xbe displayed in an emacs window (in case you use -verbose or -snoop).
XThen you will be prompted to exit emacs.  Enter 'y' when you are ready.
X
XIf you answered 'n' when prompted to send the message,
Xthen the draft message will be deleted and emacs will exit.
X
XYou can modify the Xmh.ad resources to add more buttons.
XAny MH command which accepts "+folder msg" can be used
X(e.g. a replx shell script which includes the body of the

Subject: Removing duplicate messages (Bourne)
From: Jerry Peek <jpeek at jpeek.com>
Date: 20 Nov 1995 18:51:24 GMT

  Here's a simple-minded Bourne shell version.  It uses
  "scan" to get the message number and message-id of each message.  If
  a message has the same message-id as the previous message, the
  script adds its message number to the "remove" shell variable.


	#!/bin/sh
	lastmsgid=hahahaha
	remove=
	scan -width 300 -format '%(msg) %{message-id}' |
	while read msg msgid; do
	    if [ "$msgid" = "$lastmsgid" ]; then
		remove="$remove $msg"
	    else
		lastmsgid="$msgid"
	    fi
	done
	rmm $remove

  That's pretty simple-minded.  For example, if the $remove variable
  gets too big, your system may complain.  And I'm sure there are some
  more-efficient ways to find the list of duplicate message-ids.  But
  that's the idea.
  
Subject: Removing duplicate messages (Perl)
From: rtor at ansa.co.uk (Owen Rees)

  I wrote a perl script to do this some time ago. All the usual dire
  warnings about destructive technology apply - take a backup, do it on
  a copy, try it on a small test case first etc. Don't use this script

=head1 NAME

mhfinddup - find duplicate messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

mhfinddup [options] [folder ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<mhfinddup> finds and removes duplicate MH messages in the folders listed on
the command line (default: current folder). By default, you deal with
duplicate messages interactively. You can either remove the duplicate, not
remove the duplicate, or view the original and duplicate message before
deciding.

If you use the B<-msgid> option to B<send>, then you probably don't want to
list any F<+outbox> folders if you are using the B<--no-same-folder> option
and you want to preserve your sent messages as well as your messages to
mailing lists.

Note that if you specify one or more folders, or if you use the B<--all>
option, B<mhfinddup> recursively descends the given folders.

=head1 CONTEXT

Context is per B<flist>(1). That is, if F<+folder> is given, it will become
the current folder. If multiple folders are given, the last one specified will
become the current folder.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --all

Look for duplicates in all folders. If any folders are specified, this option
is ignored.

=item --debug

Turn on debugging messages.

=item --help

Display the usage of this command.

=item --list

List duplicated messages.

=item --no-same-folder

Since it is common to use C<refile -link> to file a message in multiple
folders, this script doesn't consider messages in different folders to be
duplicates. Specify this option to list or remove duplicates across folders.

=item --rmm

Remove messages non-interactively. Use with care! For safety, the B<--list>
option takes precedence if specified and is a good option to use before using
B<--rmm>.

=item --version

Display program version.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUE

Returns 0 if all is well; non-zero otherwise.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 0

=item mhfinddup

Interactively remove duplicates from the current folder.

=item mhfinddup --all --list --no-same-folder

List all duplicates regardless if they are in different folders or not.

=item mhfinddup --rmm +lists

Remove all duplicates in F<+lists>, recursively.

=back
