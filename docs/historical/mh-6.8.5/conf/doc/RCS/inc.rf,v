\fIInc\fR incorporates mail from the user's incoming mail drop
into an \fIMH\fR folder.
If `+folder' isn't specified,
a folder in the user's \fIMH\fR directory will be used, either that
specified by the \*(lqInbox:\*(rq entry in the user's profile, or
the folder named \*(lqinbox\*(rq.
The
new messages being incorporated are assigned numbers starting
with the next highest number in the folder.
If the specified (or default) folder doesn't exist,
the user will be queried prior to its creation.
As the messages are processed,
a \fIscan\fR listing of the new mail is produced.

If the user's profile contains a \*(lqMsg\-Protect: nnn\*(rq entry, it
will be used as the protection on the newly created messages,
otherwise the \fIMH\fR default of 0644 will be used.
During all operations on messages,
this initially assigned protection will
be preserved for each message, so \fIchmod\fR(1) may be used to set a
protection on an individual message, and its protection will be
preserved thereafter.

If the switch `\-audit\ audit\-file' is specified (usually as a
default switch in the profile), then \fIinc\fR will append a header
line and a line per message to the end of the specified
audit\-file with the format:

.nf
.ti 1i
\*(<<inc\*(>> date
.ti 1.5i
<scan line for first message>
.ti 1.5i
<scan line for second message>
.ti 2.5i
<etc.>
.fi

This is useful for keeping track of volume and source of incoming
mail.
Eventually, \fIrepl\fR, \fIforw\fR, \fIcomp\fR, and \fIdist\fR may also
produce audits to this (or another) file, perhaps with
\*(lqMessage\-Id:\*(rq information to keep an exact correspondence history.
\*(lqAudit\-file\*(rq will be in the user's MH directory unless a full
path is specified.

\fIInc\fR will incorporate even improperly formatted messages into the
user's MH folder, inserting a blank line prior to the offending
component and printing a comment identifying the bad message.

In all cases, the user's mail drop will be zeroed,
unless the `\-notruncate' switch is given.

If the profile entry \*(lqUnseen\-Sequence\*(rq is present and non\-empty,
then \fIinc\fR will add each of the newly incorporated messages to each
sequence named by the profile entry.
This is similar to the \*(lqPrevious\-Sequence\*(rq profile entry supported
by all \fIMH\fR commands which take `msgs' or `msg' arguments.
Note that \fIinc\fR will not zero each sequence prior to adding messages.

The interpretation of the `\-form\ formatfile', `\-format\ string',
and `\-width\ columns' switches is the same as in \fIscan\fR\0(1).
@@BEGIN: MF

If the `\-uucp' switch is given, \fIUUCP\fR mail will be \fRinc\fRorporated
as well.  This option will work only on those sites that optionally
use \*(lqmail filtering\*(rq software.
@@END: MF

By using the `\-file\ name' switch, one can direct \fIinc\fR to incorporate
messages from a file other than the user's maildrop.
Note that the name file will NOT be zeroed,
unless the `\-truncate' switch is given.

If the envariable \fB$MAILDROP\fR is set,
then \fIinc\fR uses it as the location of the user's maildrop instead of the
default (the `-file\ name' switch still overrides this, however).
If this envariable is not set,
then \fIinc\fR will consult the profile entry \*(lqMailDrop\*(rq for this
information.
If the value found is not absolute,
then it is interpreted relative to the user's \fIMH\fR directory.
If the value is not found,
then \fIinc\fR will look in the standard system location for the user's
maildrop.

The `\-silent' switch directs \fIinc\fR to be quiet and not ask any questions
at all.
This is useful for putting \fIinc\fR in the background and going on to other
things.
@@BEGIN: POP

If the local host is configured as a POP client,
or if the `\-host\ host' switch is given,
then \fIinc\fR will query the POP service host as to the status of mail
waiting.
If the `\-user\ user' switch is not given,
then the current username is used.
Normally,
\fIinc\fR will prompt for a password to use.
However,
if the `\-apop' switch is given,
\fIinc\fR will generate authentication credentials to provide
for origin authentication and replay protection,
but which do not involve sending a password in the clear over the network.
Otherwise,
if the `\-rpop' switch is given,
then \fIinc\fR will try to use a \*(lqtrusted\*(rq connection
(ala the BSD r-commands).

If \fIinc\fR uses POP,
then the `\-pack\ file' switch is considered.
If given,
then \fIinc\fR simply uses the POP to \fIpackf\fR\0(1) the user's maildrop
from the POP service host to the named file.
This switch is provided for those users who prefer to use \fImsh\fR to
read their maildrops.

The folder into which messages are being incorporated will become the
current folder.
The first message incorporated will become the current message,
unless the `\-nochangecur' option is specified.
This leaves the context ready for a \fIshow\fR

The argument to the `\-format' switch must be interpreted as a single token
by the shell that invokes \fIinc\fR.
Therefore,
one must usually place the argument to this switch inside double\-quotes.

The `\-user\ user' switch may be given to specify the name of the POP
subscriber you wish to check mail for on the POP service host.
The `\-rpop' switch uses the UNIX \fIrPOP\fR
(authentication done via trusted connections).
In contrast, the `\-norpop' switch uses the ARPA \fIPOP\fR
(in which case \fIinc\fR will prompt for a password).
